FUCK, life is so full of crap.there is one journal entrytoday i am 15 years old. everything is all bullshit, as usual. i can't believe how fucked everything is around me. like i'm surrounded by zombies. i can't talk to any of my so-called friends, i can't talk to jamie, i can't talk to my parents. who would bother listening anyway. i cannot wait to leave orange county! this place makes me fucking sick. everyone is a hypocrite. everything is so goddamn bright and shiny and sunny and meaningless. FUCK, life is so full of crap.there is one good thing in my life though. just read this book Catcher in the Rye. blown away! i don't know how a book written decades ago could say exactly what i would say. it is like the author was reading my thoughts and put it all down in this book. things i didn't even realize i felt were right there on the page! I LOVED IT. i think this is my favorite novel of all time. which is not saying a whole lot because there is a ton of pretentious bullshit out there and i bet mrs. durham will force us to read it all. man i hate that bitch.journal entrytoday i am 20 years old. life is great as usual. just enjoyed my wednesday morning wake-and-bake session with j-p, the sun is shining, the san diego weather is beautiful, and tonight i'm off to rob & gregg's to destroy them at bullshit. love that game! gregg says that joelle will be there (yes!) but she'll probably bring that prick pete with her. one of these days i'm going to lose it and kick his ass. \"i'm in a band\"...fuck you, pete! i will never spin your records.all i have on the agenda today is to go to the gym and then off to keracik's american lit class. it is not a bad class, although it is nowhere close to gender studies with halberstam. or davidoff's survey of modern postmodernism last semester. now that was a class! it blew my mind. so many things to think about. the reading in american lit has been okay. but we've been assigned to read Catcher in the Rye and it is terrible. can't believe i ever liked this book. caulfield is a whiny little bitch. the book has no depth. there is literally nothing going on with the narrative, style, theme, characterization, it is just one rote cliché after another. he thinks he is such a rebel-without-a-cause but in reality he is just another tired representation of rootless, stereotypical masculinity and gender essentialism. completely inane and without meaning. i think my essay will use some acker-style postmodernist techniques to show how simplistic this trite \"classic\" truly is. i'm going to deconstruct the shit out of this novel, baby!journal entrytoday i am 25 years old. another gray, drizzly san francisco morning. i wish christopher would wake up, i really need to talk to him after all that shit last night. notes on my pillow, really?? time to grow up dude, i will never \"complete you\". well actually i'm glad he's still asleep, my throat is too sore to get into it right now with him. plus Food Not Bombs is happening this morning and i have to get the kitchen ready. john is probably hard at work already, typical over-achieving behavior. i bet the wisconsin kids are still crashing on our living room floor. it's time for them to leave! they've seen The Vindictives at every single Epicenter or Gilman show now and it is time for them to hit the road. or learn to take a shower. this apartment is not the world's crashpad!i woke up early this morning and thumbed through A Catcher in the Rye. i remember hating this book in college for some reason. probably wasn't po-mo enough for me. or \"challenging\". feh. what a pretentious idiot i was. this is a beautiful book. it changed my life as a kid, i'm not sure how i would have survived orange county without it. just re-reading parts of it brought back all that old angst about all the fucked-up shit in the world that kids have to deal with. i'm not sure there is another book as insightful or as meaningful. or funny! that part with the clipping-of-the-toenails is hilarious. ackley is such a douche. this book is the foundation of every zine that i have ever loved. a perfect novel. it is so....\"human\", i guess.journal entrytoday i am 30 years old. man my head hurts...so hungover! my birthday party last night was awesome. even got to spend some time on the turntables (thanks kraddy for actually relinquishing a tiny bit of control for once). i must have made out with a half-dozen people. sadly, no real action. i think last night's party will be the last big party i will ever throw. things have got to change. no  partying like the world is about to end, i still have my entire life ahead of me! tomorrow i am going to go into AIG and hand in my notice. i am not an entertainment insurance underwriter, that is not me. fuck them. if erika can get me that job working with homeless kids at Hospitality House, than i am set. although moving from the biggest room in the flat to the water heater closet will be no fun. i'm 30 years old now for chrissakes! still, i've got to do something meaningful with my life. it cannot all be about booze, drugs, hooking up, and paying everyone's rent when they're broke. things have got to change.i cracked open A Catcher in the Rye yesterday before the party and read some of my favorite parts. what an inspiration! seriously, that is a classic novel. it is packed with meaning. i'm twice caulfield's age but i still somehow connect with him in a very direct way. my life is going to change and the attitude expressed in that book is at the heart of that change. i love you, holden caulfied. it's not too late for me to learn from you, to find some meaning in life.journal entrytoday i am 35 years old. another intense, sad, but deeply fulfilling week has passed. every day something meaningful happens, something so emotional and real. sometimes i find myself just losing it in a fetal position because of the things i've seen. working with people who are drug addicted or who have been abused or who are dying is HEAVY. but it is also beautiful. it's hard to believe i am dealing with all of that and supporting my folks too. thank God i have good friends to talk to about these things. anyway. so now marcy wants to have a kid. i just don't know how i feel about that. this is such a fucked up world, do we really want to bring new life into it? i dunno. it seems....selfish, somehow. she should just quit her job with the d.a.'s office and get back to her roots in the public defender's office instead. does she think that having a child with me will bring  meaning into her life? my life has meaning enough already. and i really am not sure i can handle that responsibility on top of everything else.i skimmed A Catcher in the Rye yesterday, after an awkward talk with marcy about having a baby. it was not an inspiring read. caulfield is so full of misplaced angst! i'm not sure i even understand him any. why is he so pissed off? he's seen nothing of the world and what the world can actually do to people. i want to like him, i want to re-capture that feeling of affection i had for him, but now his contempt and his anger just seem so meaningless, so naive. he really does not have it so bad. there is so much worse out there. i don't know how i would handle a kid like that. i hate to say it, but i constantly rolled my eyes when reading it. oh the emotional self-absorption of youth! just you wait, caulfield. it sure gets a hell of a lot  complicated once you grow up.journal entrytoday i am 40 years old. when did i become a boss? it is like i woke up one day, mysteriously transformed into an old man. am i really a \"leader\"? what does that even mean? sometimes i feel like i am just faking it all and someone is going to figure it out and blow the whistle on me. last week i made a huge play on the Council, i had all my ducks in a row, and all the votes came in just as i had planned. everyone has their own agenda and the way to get things done is simply to recognize and engage with that disappointing fact. some folks got up and started clapping and then the whole room joined in, even council members who voted against my motion - feh, phonies. the experience was sort of amazing but it also made me feel very odd, almost disconnected from myself. is this who i am now, a public policy figure, a community advocate, a mayoral appointee? ugh, i can't stand the mayor. i don't feel like me. there is accomplishment there, and some satisfaction... but i am missing something, something visceral, something real. sweet Jesus, is this what a mid-life crisis feels like? it is a weird feeling, like i know everything that i need to know about the world, about the people around me, how everything connects, but yet i still feel like i know so little about life. oh, such angst, mark. surely you've outgrown this?i've started re-reading A Catcher in the Rye. it's so strange, during different parts, i felt like crying. a wonderful and moving novel. i feel like i really understand holden, like he is my guide, my son, my brother, my friend... myself. i think of him and i know that change in the world and changing myself can still happen. it just has to happen. that's life after all, right?",

Every time I reread a corny book that I really liked when I was a kid it makes me want to give the writer a buzz and ask what the hell is going on. It’s like they are trying to give you the time in the back of a cab when you don’t feel like getting the time at all. It’s damn depressing, I swear to God it is. If you want to know the truth, you probably couldn’t even talk to a phony writer on the phone. You would just end up talking to his butler or some snobbish person like that and asking if they would give the writer your message. He probably wouldn’t even do it. The thing with guys like that is that they will never give writers your messages. That’s something that annoys the hell out of me. Turns out this is still a damn good book. Salinger kid is a great writer. He really is. Maybe I’m still just an angst-ridden sonuvabitch, but this part kills me:“All the kids kept trying to grab for the gold ring, and so was old Phoebe, and I was sort of afraid she’d fall off the goddam horse, but I didn’t say anything or do anything. The thing with kids is, if they want to grab for the gold ring, you have to let them do it, and not say anything. If they fall off, they fall off, but it’s bad if you say anything to them.”p.211I’ll bet everyone is going to think that I’m just horsin’ around or trying to be all sexy talking like this. The reason for this corny review is because a thousand other people have already written reviews for this book and I’ll bet that they have already said everything that I want to say. It’s pretty depressing. It really is. That’s about all that I’m going to talk about. Now I just hope that no one writes “fuck you” on this review. That’s the thing with some people, they are always sneaking up and writing “fuck you” on your book reviews when you are not looking. They really are.",
        "I read this book for the first time in the 8th grade. I had to get my mom to sign a permission slip because of the cursing. Before I began reading, I had so many expectations. Back then, I read Seventeen Magazine, and back then, Seventeen Magazine ran brainy features about books and poetry. There was one feature where they asked people what book changed their lives, and something like  than half said Catcher in the Rye. I think there might have been some celebrity comments in there, too. At I read this book for the first time in the 8th grade. I had to get my mom to sign a permission slip because of the cursing.

Not only did I hate Holden, but I hated everything about the novel. There was nothing I enjoyed. I did my book report where I confessed my hatred (which led my teacher to confess that she did, too), but I couldn't let it go. I honestly felt that my loathing of a novel that so many others found \"life-changing\" indicated some deep and horrible flaw. I felt like hating Catcher in the Rye was my dirty little secret.Time passed, and my self-loathing mellowed. I began to think that perhaps I'd come at it too young, so after my first year of college, I decided to re-read it, go at it with fresh eyes, and see if my opinion had changed.Here's the thing: it hasn't. I get it. I get that Holden is supposed to be loathsome. I get that he is the hypocrite he hates. I get that almost all teenagers go through the kind of thinking he experiences. I get it. I do. I just don't like it.Oh, and I'm not ashamed any.",

However, having first read it almost 25 years ago, I knew I had to read it again before I could feel justified in actually reviewing it. Of course, I didn’t hold out much hope that my feelings would change and was expecting a fairly painful reading experiece. In fact, as I started reading, I was already thinking about what my amazingly insightful, completely “isn’t it cool to bash on the classics” 1 star review was going to focus on. I thought maybe I could bag on the less than spectacular prose used by Salinger (making myself feel really smart in the process). Or maybe I could take some jabs at the less than exciting narrative pacing (and throw in a few references to \"watching paint dry\"). In the end, I thought my most likely avenue for attacking reviewing this anthem of teen angst was that it was utterly yawn inspiringno longer relevant today because of the GLUT of teen angst that the recent generations have been exposed to ad nauseam growing up. I mean we live in a time in which teen angst is EVERYWHERE and even has its own sub-genre label now. You can find it in:MUSIC............MOVIES...........AND EVEN THE SHITTY POPULAR LITERATURE*** OF OUR TIMES... *** Literature is a serious stretch, but I must admit that these books do IN FACT fill me with ANGST!!!...So what happened to all of the preconceived notions I had before I starting reading this book? Instead, I found myself completely drawn into the rich, nuanced story of Holden Caulfield. I found myself empathizing with Caulfield almost from the beginning (something I did not expect to do). His \"annoying\", \"pseudo rebellious\" and \"just don't care\" exterior were so obviously manufactured and so patently hiding a seriously sad and lost boy that I was transfixed on finding the real Holden Caulfield. Despite the book being written \"in Holden's own words\" the reader was still able to discern that Holden's surface response to a situation was hiding a much deeper, emotional resposne. For Salinger to be able to infuse that kind of nuance into the sparse prose of Caulfield’s narrative was nothing short of brilliant in my opinion. Caulfied is lazy. He is stubborn. He is immature. He is unfocused. He is untruthful. He is dangerously short-sighted and he is lost in his own world or unrealistic expectations. Sounds like that could certainly be a not unsubstantial portion of the male 16 year old population. However, after reading this book, I learned a few other things about Holden that I though were fascinating and that are not as often discussed:1.\tHe is desperately lonely (he even goes so far as ask his cab drivers to join him for a drink);2.\tHe is generous with his time and his things (he writes an essay for his roommate despite being upset with him and even lets him borrow his jacket); 3.\tHe is extremely sensitive and longs for an emotional (rather than just a physical) commitment (he mentions several times his need to “be in love” in order to be physical and his experience with the prostitute certainly bears this out);4.\tHe is intelligent (despite being lazy and unfocused, Holden displays great insight and intelligence regarding books he has read and displays at the museum); and 5.\tDespite being unable to process it correctly, he is full of compassion and has a deep capacity for love, which he shows most notably for his sister (this was one of the most powerful parts of the story for me as it was Holden’s desire to avoid hurting Phoebe that keeps him from running away at the end of the book).  Taking all of the good and the bad together, I was left with the feeling that Holden is an adolescent on the cusp of adulthood who is achingly afraid of the loss of his childhood and the responsibility and commitment that he sees as required to make it in the “adult” world. He is compassionate, intelligent and deeply emotional and yet is unable (or unwilling) to focus that energy on those steps that he sees as leading him away from his “happy memories of childhood” and closer to the “scary world of the adult.” I think this is superbly shown in Holden's expressed dream of wanting to being the “Catcher in the Rye.” Quick side note: I had no idea what the title to the book referred to until I just read the book. Here is a person so afraid of growing up and so averse to giving into the pain and sadness that he sees as the result of becoming an adult that he wants nothing  than to spend his life protecting others from losing the innocence of childhood. Big, crazy, “I want to save the world” dreams are a wonderful part of childhood and it is a shame that such ideas and beliefs are too often destroyed under the barrage of “you really need to grow up” rather than having such dreams transitioned and re-focused into daring the improbable within the world of the possible. A great and moving reading experience and one that I give my HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!! ",
        "I read the end of The Catcher in the Rye the other day and found myself wanting to take Holden Caulfield by the collar and shake him really, really hard and shout at him to grow up.

I suppose I've understood for some time now that The Catcher in the Rye -- a favorite of mine when I was sixteen -- was a favorite precisely because I was sixteen. At sixteen, I found Holden Caulfield's crisis profoundly moving; I admired his searing indictment of society, his acute understanding of human nature, his extraordinary sensitivity (I mean, come on, he had a nervous breakdown for God's sake, he had to be sensitive). At sixteen, I wanted to marry Holden Caulfield. At forty, I want to spank him. After all, Holden's indictment of society boils down to the \"insight\" that everybody is a phony. That's the kind of insight a sixteen year old considers deep. A forty year old of the grown-up variety recognizes Holden's insight as superficial and banal, indulging in the cheapest kind of adolescent posturing. It suggests a grasp of society and of human nature that's about as complex as an episode of Dawson's Creek. Holden and his adolescent peers typically behave as though the fate they have suffered (disillusionment and the end of innocence) is unique in human history. He can't see beyond the spectacle of his own disillusionment (and neither can J. D. Salinger); for all his painful self-consciousness, Holden Caulfield is not really self-aware. He can't see that he himself is a phony. Compare Salinger's novel of arrested development, for instance, with a real bildungsroman, Great Expectations. Holden Caulfield is an adolescent reflecting on childhood and adolescence; Pip Pirrip is an adult reflecting on childhood and adolescence. Holden Caulfield has the tunnel vision of teendom, and he depicts events with an immediacy and absorption in the experience that blocks out the broader context, the larger view. Pip Pirrip has the wonderful double vision of a sensitive adult recollecting the sensitive child he used to be; he conveys at the same time the child's compelling perspective and the adult's thoughtful revision of events. While Holden Caulfield litters his narrative with indignant exposes of phonies and frauds, Pip Pirrip skillfully concentrates on \"the spurious coin of his own make\" -- that is, without letting the child Pip and the adolescent Pip in on the joke, he exposes himself as a phony. Pip Pirrip grows up. Holden Caulfield has a nervous breakdown. I suppose the only reason I begrudge him his breakdown is that so many in our culture -- many , unfortunately, than just the legitimate adolescents among us -- seem fixated on Holden as a symbol of honesty and socially-liberating rebellion. We view nervous collapse and dysfunction as a badge of honor, a sign -- to put it in Caulfieldian terms -- that we are discerning enough to see through all the crap. Our celebration of overwrought disaffection reminds me of the last sentence of Joyce’s Araby: “Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger.” Here is the adolescent pose non-pareil. Equally self-accusing and self-aggrandizing, it captures the adolescent at the precise moment when his own disillusionment becomes the object of his grandiose and self-dramatizing vision. That’s the kind of crap that Holden Caulfield (and J. D. Salinger) cannot see through. And it is often the kind of crap that we “adults” like to slosh around in. The Barney beating of several years ago is another symptom of our arrested adolescence, our inability to ride the wave of disillusion into the relatively calm harbor of adulthood -- as though flailing around in the storm and raging at the wind were in themselves marks of distinction and a superior sensibility. I remember a news story about a woman in a Barney costume being seriously injured when a rabid (and probably drunken) anti-Barney fanatic attacked the big purple dinosaur at some public event. Now, I don’t know the age of the Barney-beater, but the act itself is a supremely adolescent one, in which the impulsive response to disillusionment is to lash out at those symbols of childhood which made the biggest dupes of us. At the dawn of adolescence, when Barney begins to appear cloying and false, it seems natural to want to beat up on him, as though it was Barney himself who pulled one over on us instead of our own poignant and necessary misapprehension of the nature of things. I could see Holden Caulfield beating up on Barney (at least rhetorically), and I could see Holden Caulfield missing Barney (as he misses all the “phonies” at the end of the book), but I cannot see Holden Caulfield accepting the postlapsarian Barney on new terms, as a figure who is meant for children and not for him. For all his touching poses about wanting to be the “catcher in the rye,” what Holden really wants is not to save children but to be a child again.",

Chekhov's 'normal' little people seem  real and alive than Salinger's because Chekhov injects a little oddness, a little madness into each one. Real people are almost never quite as boring as modernist depictions, because everyone has at least some ability to surprise you.Salinger's world is desaturated. Emotions and moments seep into one another, indistinct as the memories of a drunken party. Little importance is granted to events or thoughts, but simply pass by, each duly tallied by an author in the role of court reporter.What is interesting about this book is not that it is realistically bland, but that it is artificially bland. Yet, as ridiculous a concept as that is, it still takes itself entirely in earnest, never acknowledging the humor of its own blase hyperbole.This allows the book to draw legions of fans from all of the ridiculously dull people who take themselves as seriously as Holden takes himself. They read it not as a parody of bland egotism but a celebration, poised to inspire all the bland egotists who have resulted from the New Egalitarianism in Art, Poetry, Music, and Academia.Those same folks who treat rationality and intellectual fervor like a fashion to be followed, imagining that the only thing required to be brilliant is to mimic the appearance and mannerisms of the brilliant; as if black berets were the cause of poetic inspiration and not merely a symptom.One benefit of this is that one can generally sniff out pompous faux intellectuals by the sign that they hold up Holden as a sort of messianic figure. Anyone who marks out Holden as a role-model is either a deluded teen with an inflated sense of entitlement, or is trying to relive the days when they were.But what is  interesting is that those who idolize Holden tend to be those who most misunderstand him. Upon close inspection, he's not depressive, not consumed with ennui or an existential crisis, he's actually suffering from 'Shell Shock'--now known as 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder'.The way he thinks about his brother's and classmate's deaths--going over the details again and again in his mind, but with no emotional connection--it's not symptomatic of depression, but of psychological trauma. He is stuck in a cycle, unable to process events, going over them again and again, but never able to return to normalcy.It takes a certain kind of self-centered prick to look at someone's inability to cope with the reality of death and think \"Hey, that's just like my mild depression over how my parents won't buy me a newer ipod!\" It's not an unusual stance in American literature--there's an arrogant detachment in American thought which has become less and less pertinent as the world grows and changes. As recently as The Road we have American authors comparing a difficult father-son relationship to the pain and turmoil of an African civil war survivor--and winning awards for displaying their insensitive arrogance.Perhaps it's time we woke up and realized that the well-fed despondence of the white man should not be equated with a lifetime of death, starvation, war, and traumas both physical and emotional. And as for Salinger--a real sufferer of Post-Traumatic Stress who was one of the first soldiers to see a concentration camp, who described how you can never forget the smell of burning flesh--I can only imagine how he felt when people read his story of a man, crippled by the thought of death, and thought to themselves \"Yes, that's just what it's like to be a trustafarian with uncool parents\". No wonder he became a recluse and stopped publishing.",
        "J.D. Salinger’s ‘Catcher in the Rye’ was published on July 16, 1951. It was his first novel. It became very popular among young adolescents yet not so popular with older generations. I personally thoroughly enjoyed every part of this book. I felt very close to Holden Caulfield, the main character in the story, as I read it. Holden Caulfield, a sixteen year old boy from New York, was quite unlike kids his age. He had no interest in being popular or social. From the very beginning he lets us into J.D. Salinger’s ‘Catcher in the Rye’ was published on July 16, 1951. It was his first novel. It became very popular among young adolescents yet not so popular with older generations. I personally thoroughly enjoyed every part of this book. I felt very close to Holden Caulfield, the main character in the story, as I read it. Holden Caulfield, a sixteen year old boy from New York, was quite unlike kids his age. He had no interest in being popular or social. From the very beginning he lets us into part of his personal life. His parents are very touchy and his mother is especially protective. It becomes clear very quickly where Holden’s interests lie and where they start to veer off. He tends to lean away from the fake in the world and is a teller of what is real. Holden is not a fan of the movies at all. He saw his brother, D.B., throw away his natural writing talent all for a large Hollywood check. Any other boy Holden’s age would have been absolutely ecstatic to have a sibling working amongst the stats in Hollywood, but not Holden. It was all far too “phony” for him; and phony is his worst enemy. Salinger’s use of sarcasm and irony is beautiful and hilarious. As I read through each chapter I found myself highlighting funny, sarcastic things Holden would say or think (and trust me, there are DOZENS of time where this occurs.) One specific time in Chapter 8 he is talking to a cab driver who is acting like a real fool. Holden says to the readers, “He certainly was good company. Terrific personality.” Salinger’s character Holden is actually a lot like Salinger in his real life. Like Holden, Salinger was known for his reclusive nature. Uninterested with the fakeness of the world, Holden keeps his distance from phony people. After Salinger’s success of ‘The Catcher in the Rye’, he slowed down his publishing and slowly but surely drifted out of the public eye. To this day Salinger refuses any offers to have ‘The Catcher’ put on the big Hollywood screen. Salinger’s ex lover, Joyce Maynard, even once said that, “The only person who might ever have played Holden Caulfield would have been J.D. Salinger.” It seems to me that it is no coincidence that Holden is no fan of Hollywood and that Salinger in real life and doesn’t want anything to do with turning his popular novel into a movie. Holden says, “If there’s one thing I hate, it’s the movies, Don’t even mention them to me.”Since I have learned  about Salinger’s personal life, I recognize a lot of Salinger’s personality in Holden. In the story, Holden has overbearing parents much like Salinger’s parents. Salinger said his mother was over protective. Salinger has one sibling, a sister, which is ironic because it is Holden’s sister Phoebe who has a profound influence on Holden. He often talks about her with very high regards.Holden is not a character who tried to sugarcoat the way he sees the fakeness around him. Holden, making fun of the people around him, often says things like “you would’ve puked” and “it was very phony”. I think that is another one of the reasons I like his character so much. For example, he is quite upset with the fact that his brother D.B. is selling his work to Hollywood instead of using his talents for his own pleasure. Holden even says that his brother is his favorite author. Salinger himself is a man who wrote for his own pleasure and likeness. I made a similar connection to a girl named Sally that Holden likes in the book, to a real life lover of Salinger’s named Oona. Oona O’Neil was self-absorbed and stuck up, according to Salinger, yet he still phoned and wrote her letters quite often. Holden’s “Oona” in the story was a girl named Sally Hayes. Though he found her extremely irritating he thought she was very attractive as well. After spending a day with her, he pointed out about a dozen instances where he thought she was being “phone as hell”. By the end of their only meeting in the book, Holden says to Sally, “You give me a royal pain in the ass if you want to know the truth.” The real life Oona O’Neil ended up breaking it off with Salinger and married the famous actor, Charlie Chaplin.Despite Holden being a sixteen year old teenage boy he acts much older than his age. One time in the story he has the chance to be with a prostitute but instead of acting like a pig, he starts to feel sorry for her and instead tried to have a conversation with her. He even offers to pay her for good conversation instead of for sex. He also stays alone in hotels randomly, drinks at bars and clubs often, and even tells people he’s older than he really is. But the reason I find his character mature and intellectual is for other reasons.Holden does not hold money or material things to be really important. He is  excited to hang out with his kid sister than he is any other time in the entire book. He is content with something that would probably be boring to other guys his age.Like many teenagers, Holden is often depressed. The way he deals with it most times actually breaks my heart in a way. He likes to talk to his deceased kid brother, Allie. He will take a real event that he can remember where he was talking with him and pretend he is talking to him again. He says, “I started talking out loud to Allie. I do that sometimes when I get very depressed.” It is really very heart wrenching to hear Holden talk about his brother. One of my favorite moments in the book is when Holden and Phoebe are talking in Phoebe’s room and she points out that Holden doesn’t like anything. Holden responds quickly by saying, “I like Allie. And I like doing what I’m doing right now. Sitting here with you and talking and thinking about stuff…” Phoebe says to Holden, “Allie’s dead-you always say that! If somebody’s dead and everything, and in heaven then it isn’t really--”. Holden interrupts her with his final comeback, “I know he’s dead! Don’t you think I know that? I can still like him, though, can’t I? just because somebody’s dead, you don’t just stop liking them, for God’s sake- especially if they were about a thousand times nicer than the people you know that’re alive and all.”One of the most beautiful things about ‘The Catcher in the Rye’ is the way Salinger uses symbolism. From Holden’s red hunting hat, to Jane Gallagher’s checker playing technique, Salinger wrapped up  than meets the eye into things you never would have dreamed. The main thing that drew me into this story is the realness of Holden’s character. He is a teenage boy with a teenage boy’s mind but seems to have far  common sense than anyone else around him. He is not a jock. He is not a math whiz or a science whiz. He is not really interested in sports. He sort of makes up his own category; a category that I call ‘the genuine’. He is on his own a lot and loves it at first, but happiness and love are meant to be shared with others. It has a much less meaning when by itself and he realizes it by the end of the novel. He is growing intellectually little by little throughout the whole book. He realizes what really makes him happy. I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone and everyone who would like to read a story that could possibly change the way they view the world. I have honestly laughed outloud to myself as I read this story. Yes, there is talk about drinking, sex, and lots of cussing, but if you are going to avoid reading this story because of that then your missing out on a beautiful masterpiece. ",

That is easily one of the saddest, most pathetic introductions to a book. As I started this book, I wondered... if the introduction is like this, how will the rest of the book be?This is what the rest of the book looked like:\"He was also the nicest, in lots of ways. He never got mad at anybody. People with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily, but Allie never did, and he had very red hair. I'll tell you what kind of red hair he had.\" \"I sort of used to go to Allie's baseball matches.\"\"It was around ten-thirty, I guess, when I finished it.\" I can imagine Holden as this very insipid, boring little kid with no life in him whatsoever. Also, Holden thinks everyone besides him is a phony and a moron. And he makes it very clear because he mentions it, like, every two pages. Literally... every damn time. I read some of the comments regarding how I didn't understand this book because I didn't relate to it. That may be true. Very, very true. Regardless, I still think to this day that this book is a drag and has an unlikable main character and a dry, boring writing style. Perhaps I will read it again when I am older and maybe I'll enjoy it. ",

SalingerThe Catcher in the Rye is a 1951 novel by J. D. Salinger. Holden Caulfield, a teenager from New York City, is living in an unspecified institution in southern California near Hollywood in 1951. Story of Holden Caulfield with his idiosyncrasies, penetrating insight, confusion, sensitivity and negativism. The hero-narrator of \"The Catcher in the Rye\" is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices -- but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: بار نخست ماه آگوست سال 1982 میلادی، بار دوم در سال 2001 میلادی و سومین بار در ماه ژوئن سال 2005 میلادیعنوان: ناطور دشت؛ نویسنده: جروم دیوید (جی.د.) سالینجر؛ مترجم: احمد کریمی؛ تهران، فرانکلین، 1345؛ در 354 ص؛ چاپ دیگر: تهران، اشرفی، 1371؛ چاپ دیگر: تهران، ققنوس، 1381؛ در 326 ص؛ شابک: 9643112543؛ چاپ چهارم 1385؛ چاپ پنجم: تهران، علمی، فرهنگی، 1386؛ در 326 ص؛ شابک: 9789643112547؛ چاپ ششم 1387؛ چاپ هفتم 1388، هشتم 1389؛ سال 1393 ؛ چاپ دیگر: 1393؛ در 256 ص؛ شابک: 9786001215930؛ موضوع: نوجوانان فراری - داستانهای نویسندگان امریکایی - سده 20 معنوان: ناتور دشت؛ مترجم: محمد نجفی؛ تهران، نیلا، 1378، در 296 ص؛ چاپ چهارم 1381؛ چاپ پنجم 1384 در 207 ص؛ هفتم 1388؛ هشتم 1389؛ چاپ نهم 1393؛داستان جوانی جسور و جستجوگر، در پی مفهوم زندگی. «هولدن کالفیلد:، نوجوانی هفده ساله، که در آغاز رمان، در یک مرکز درمانی بستری است، و ظاهراً قصد دارد، آن‌چه که پیش از رسیدن به مرکز درمانی را، از سر بگذرانده، برای کسی بازگو کند، همین ‌کار را هم می‌کند. رمان بر همین پایه شکل می‌گیرد. در زمان رخداد رویدادهای داستان، «هولدن» یک پسر بچه ی شانزده‌ ساله‌ است، که در مدرسه ی شبانه‌ روزی «پنسی»، درس می‌خواند، و در آستانه ی کریسمس، به علت ضعف تحصیلی، از دبیرستان اخراج میشود، و باید به خانه‌ شان در «نیویورک» برگردد. همه ی رویدادهای داستان، طی سه روز، که «هولدن»، از مدرسه، برای رفتن به خانه خارج می‌شود، رخ می‌دهند. او می‌خواهد: «تا نامه ی مدیر، مبنی بر اخراجش، به دست پدر و مادرش برسد، و آب‌ها از آسیاب بیفتد به خانه ی خویش پا نگذارد». به همین ‌خاطر از زمانیکه از مدرسه خارج ‌میشود، دو روز را به سرگردانی سپری می‌کند. این دو روز نمادی است، از سفر «هولدن»، از کودکی به دنیای جوانی. رمان اصلی در سال 1951 میلادی منتشر شده، برگردان فارسی رمان، یعنی همین کتاب با عنوان: «ناطور دشت»، با ترجمه ی جناب «احمد کریمی»، در دهه ی پنجاه هجری خورشیدی منتشر گردیده است. سپس برگردان دیگری با عنوان: «ناتور دشت»، با ترجمه ی حناب: «محمد نجفی»، در دهه ی هفتاد هجری خورشیدی نیز منتشر شده است. ا. شربیانی",

Count the number of times he lies or behaves like someone he's not and then try to convince me otherwise. This is not a book about teenage alienation.

There really aren’t many choices available, and we are certainly sheltered from a lot of the harder parts of life. It seems like children don’t feel the need for meaning quite like adults do- maybe because they aren’t forced to face the daily grind. There’s boredom, but that is not what I am talking about. Kids don’t really have to compromise like adults do. As you enter adulthood you could start to see things and people as phony or fake. Maybe not people, but certain tasks or events certainly are. There’s a constant struggle in all of us between the meaningful and the mundane; the temporary and the eternal. There is a conflict, simply of time and energy. We desire the intentional and struggle towards spirituality; all while trying to earn a paycheck, wash our dishes, and sleep each night. It kind of reminds me of what I picture an AA meeting to look like. I think, rarely could someone find a place where people are  vulnerable, open, and honest with each other. Even if they win over addiction… how could life ever feel as full after that brief moment shared with others who completely understand? At the same time, the point of those meetings is to help people live- not just free from drugs, but maybe free to live in the mundane? Free to enjoy the dance of life, the needs of the soul balanced with the chores too. This doesn’t have to be depressing, but it does require compromise- or a sense of a time and place for everything- including the day-to-day.Catcher in the rye touches on some of these questions. Holden struggles with growing up. He sees everything as meaningless and adults as predictable and fake. I think he is mourning the loss of his innocence… maybe not just right from wrong, but the loss of dreams growing up seems to require. Holden, while at the museum that is exactly the same as it was when he was a kid says he likes it, because each time you visit \"the only thing that would be different would be you…\" and goes on to say \"certain things they should stay the way they are. You ought to be able to stick them in one of those big glass cases and just leave them alone. I know that's impossible, but it’s too bad anyway.\" One thing I thought of to help explain Holden's struggle with growing up is this: Coffee. When I was a kid, I used to smell my dad's coffee- that strong sugary-sweet smell of roasted beans. You wait for your chance to be let in on this excellent secret. Thinking it is just the caffeine that is preventing your parents from giving you a taste. Finally, they do and then all your dreams of that sweet flavor come crashing down! It's wrecked! Coffee isn't at all what you thought it was! That is, until the day you give it another chance, you start to be able to smell and taste the different tones coffee has. You can appreciate it for its varied, and almost living flavors. You see… Coffee isn't bad- it just wasn't what you always thought. The key is in finding the hidden flavors and getting over the fact that it will never taste as sweet as it smells. I think Holden struggled with the initial shock, that although life is  bitter than it \"smells\", or than you think it will be, there are the hidden joys and sweet flavors that make it almost better!This book doesn’t really set out to answer any of the questions it raises. Holden experiences the extremes of entering into adulthood and relates it in a way everyone, maybe especially, teenagers can understand. He is a flawed character who is desperate and depressed. As the reader, you can see why he feels the way he does, as he explains it so well you almost feel it with him. However, you can also see the flaws in his thinking. The author doesn't romanticize Holden's life, you don't read it thinking he has some special key to life that we all need. You simply feel his struggle to fit in and hope eventually he can learn to play the game and see the beauty that is there, hidden a little.",

At first when brian told me, I thought, 'Oh, well... He was old. He was (probably) batshit crazy anyway. It was his time to check out, I guess.' Really. What difference does it make? He's been dead to the world since the mid-1960s. Before I was even born. A strong case could be made that he truly died in spirit when he started stalking Elaine Joyce on the set of 1980s sitcom Mr. Merlin. And yet... I still clung to this (still technically living) legend as if he were some kind of talisman I could wear around my neck, a good luck charm to ward off phonies and all manner of soulless dreck who populate this despicable world, writing 'fuck' on grammar school walls (and metaphorical equivalents). After returning for a few minutes to my soul-deadening job, which -- when you really get right down to it -- is just another way of killing time until I join Salinger in oblivion, I started getting all funny-feeling about it. At the risk of sounding like an adult contemporary power ballad written by Jim Steinman, with synthesized violins in the background, I began to feel as if my adolescence had finally come to an end. I guess it's about time. I'm thirty-eight years old, and yet I look at the people who are my age -- hell, who are even much younger than I am -- and who appear in all particulars to be adults, and I grow frightened/alarmed that they've graduated to the 'next level': they're mating and spawning and drawing up wills and completing their own tax returns and investing money and dealing (gracefully -- or with stoicism?) with the deaths of friends and relatives... and even some of them have died themselves of terrible diseases -- the kinds of diseases which are not content with merely claiming lives but which demand the optimal human suffering (the optimal dehumanization) before they cash in. So of course. I love all of Salinger's writing, but his value in my life has far surpassed that of a 'mere' literary pastime. He has kept me company for many years when I felt left behind by the exigencies of time and the claims of 'maturity.' In my head, I still picture myself as a nineteen-year-old, and I'm shocked again and again when somehow every other moron on the planet seems to be under the ridiculous impression that I'm a thirty-eight-year-old man. With graying hair. And deepening crow's feet. What idiots!I know all of this shit I'm saying is cliché, cliché, cliché. Lots and lots of people feel a special connection to Salinger's writing -- for just the reasons I described -- and lots and lots of people hate his writing because they find it grating and immature (Catcher in the Rye) or pretentious and ponderous (the Glass family stories). But I felt compelled to commemorate today in some way -- however trite and superfluous -- because I sense again and again (with the relatively recent deaths of some of my heroes, like Ingmar Bergman and Jacques Derrida, for instance) that I am entering a world that is no longer safeguarded by the great men and women of the elder generation; I am entering a world in which I am now the elder... with my own responsibilities and obligations. Yes, this still frightens me, but I'll always have Salinger's very particular and empathetic world to which to retreat when I have sacrificed too much of myself to a real world I'll never completely understand or feel at home in.",

It's not even helpful, realistic, smart, beneficial ...\" The answer is that the teenager is in a state of transition, moving from the relatively defined environment of childhood to the jungle of the adult world, and completely without tools to handle that journey. Using swearwords, trying different ways to tune out reality, not doing what one is supposed to do, those are all different methods of practicing the BIG SCARE. Growing up. Facing responsibility. Soon, soon, soon ... the teenager will have to earn money, make decisions, take care of others. And the weight is heavy on the young shoulders. Roaming the streets relaxes nerves. But still. There is an element of idealism in most teenagers' hearts. They don't usually want to fall into the traps of conventional evil. They want to change the world, make a difference. They are just struggling to come up with ideas how to do that, as their experience is limited. And they can't put their ideas into a wider context either. So being a catcher in the rye may make sense. It isn't necessarily the teenager's fault if nobody turns up where they wait to save lives, right? Teenage intentions are  often than not good. The results vary though.And their verbal skills are developing in conjunction with their minds as well:\"Happily, some of them kept records of their troubles. You'll learn from them—if you want to. Just as someday, if you have something to offer, someone will learn something from you. It's a beautiful reciprocal arrangement. And it isn't education. It's history. It's poetry.\"Teenage minds are indeed  poetry than prose: fractured, fragmented, emotional, in the moment, beautiful and fleeting. Luckily, some of them remember later and share, - for us teachers to enjoy when we think it is impossible to understand the monsters that all of a sudden show up at the end of Grade 7, replacing lovely and enthusiastic children over night!I hope some of my students use the long summer to enter the beautiful arrangement Holden suggests and read this classic.

But he's a character that, for some strange reason, resonates with thousands of people. Why? Well, simply put, it's because he's written like this on purpose. But I think that doesn't quite get to the heart of it. Holden is a fifteen-year-old kid on the verge of an emotional breakdown. He's an asshole. He's a liar. He's a hypocrite. And he's also... really relatable. See, as a preteen, I struggled with severe emotional issues. I had depression and anxiety, although I didn't know it yet. I was going through major emotional issues with my parents, ones far worse than teen angst. I was on the lowest rung of the social pole at school. And God, I was an asshole. I was whiny and I was a hypocrite. I knew it, too, and I cried myself to sleep thinking about it. In the daylight, I told myself everyone else was terrible and that's why my world was falling apart. I was just as hypocritical and torn up inside as Holden is. Holden is an asshole, granted. But he is an asshole that it's hard not to relate to. So all this is to say that I completely understand why so many hated this book. But it resonates with me, and with so many people I know, for the exact reason that it will be polarizing. This is the kind of book that's going to be incredibly divisive. This is the kind of book that should maybe be taught by a teacher who loves it (thanks, 9th grade English teacher who hated me.) And this is the kind of book that sticks in my head, a year after I first read it. VERDICT: I really do recommend this, even knowing at least half its readership will despise it. It's truly worth the read. ",

Because - oh the horror! - they dare to focus on the readers' opinion rather than the coveted by conglomerates endorsements of THE PRODUCT. Because for some of us literature does not equal product. Because for some of us, literature is what is designed to make us think and speak up, and not mindlessly consume (consumer instead of reader - that's making me shudder).But first I WILL digress (and it seems I already have). And Holden Caulfield, the conflicted rebel with all the makings of a phony of the kind he detests, would probably approve. And if Holden approves, who the hell cares if Goodreads or Amazon do? “It’s this course where each boy in class has to get up in class and make a speech. You know. Spontaneous and all. And if the boy digresses at all, you’re supposed to yell ‘Digression!’ at him as fast as you can. It just about drove me crazy. I got an F in it.”“Why?”“Oh, I don’t know. That digression business got on my nerves. I don’t know. The trouble with me is, I like it when somebody digresses. It’s  interesting and all.”..........................You can't really love The Catcher in the Rye if you are feeling happy and content. At least I can't. When I'm happy, all I see is a moody overly judgmental privileged teenager looking for reasons to bitch about the world and being immature and a phony. I have to feel some discontent to appreciate the hiding behind that facade helpless anger, pain, loss and a rebellious streak. Holden is - or at least sometimes unsuccessfully trying to be - a rebel. A troublemaker. A square peg in a round hole. (Yes, I am very aware I'm quoting the Apple commercial. So sue me. Maybe it's off-topic or something. You decide.)And right now I am not happy and content seeing the site I used to love heading down the road that is perilous at best. The road that clearly shows preference towards consumers over readers. The consumerism mantra of buy-buy-buy is taking precedence over think-disagree-discuss-passionately argue-watch the truth being born. Holden Caulfield would not approve of such change in direction. And neither do I or so many people I have come to respect, people whose opinions help me discover the works of literature that I love.Holden Caulfield's views and his expression of them were, admittedly, often juvenile, poorly thought-through and frequently just as phony as those of people he reviles. He was quick to jump to judgment, ignoring those who really cared for him. He was prejudiced, snobbish and arrogant, and a habitual liar, too. How often do the readers want to reach into the book and shake some sense into this boy spiraling down into desperation and a breakdown?And yet there is something about the unhappy rebellious teenager that still resonates with us despite the obvious flaws. It is his anger itself, the rage against the world that is fake and all about appearances, about the power imbalance, about the smugness the powerful of this world carry with them. His emotions are so raw and so sincere that I may disagree with some of them but I sure as hell can't ignore them.As we probably all know too well, The Catcher in the Rye has been one of the most challenged books of the 20th century, riling up the emotions and protests of the wannabe censors who thought it was their sacred duty to shield and protect the public from the work of literature that dared to offend their tender sensibilities. These self-appointed sensors were (quite ironically, if you think about it) trying to be nothing less than the self-appointed Catchers in the Rye, protecting our childlike innocence from falling prey to The Catcher in the Rye. What they fail to grasp is that the point of the book itself is that such seemingly noble efforts are useless, worthless, and quite phony in their presumptuousness of knowing what's best; that these efforts are a slippery slope that is futile and dangerous.Just as it is equally presumptuous and patronizing and dangerous for any power to tell book readers there is a proper way to express their opinions, that they need to stay ON TOPIC (or else there will be a delete-button action equal to the shriek of 'Digression!' gleefully coming from Holden's classmates). Playing self-appointed Catcher in the Rye to the delicate sensibilities of certain bookselling sites, entitled writers or a bunch of offended fans, shifting the focus from discussing literature to reviewing product and collecting data - all this is just as misguided as Holden's futile efforts of saving children from growing up.You see, this is what I love about Salinger's so often contested work - its ability to stir thoughts and opinions that go beyond the plot and the book report and make you think, and maybe -just maybe - be a touch rebellious, too. This is dangerous, in the best meaning of this word, the meaning that makes all the self-appointed censors uneasy. These censors would rather have everyone toe the line and do what's expected and never have to face anything that even remotely upsets delicate sensibilities.  But Holden Caulfield goes on being subversive. And occasionally being off topic - and that's perfectly fine by me. \"Oh, I don’t know. That digression business got on my nerves. I don’t know.

Also, I’d probably have to take the time to learn how to italicize things on GoodReads, which would probably be worthwhile, but my computer skills could easily be outshone by a resuscitated troglodyte fresh from an ice-block. Added to that, I don’t know how long I could go on trying to poorly mimic the book without wanting to puke, I mean, not only is it a crumby thing to do to, but it’s also phony as hell.\tSo what do I think about the madman exploits of old Holden Caufield, perhaps one of the most acclaimed protagonists in all of American literature? No terribly much, as a matter of fact: each time I’ve read this book I wanted to kill myself. Holden’s always saying things like that, I mean, if you were to wear one blue sock and one red sock, and maybe slowly skin your shrivelfig under the comforting cotton of a green sock, he’d say something like, “God how I hate how that guy messes around with his socks, it makes me want to kill myself.” In that case, you’d better hope you’re at least in possession of a decent valise, lest that bastard Caulfield spread some  wrath upon you for your clearly inferior luggage. That guy, he really cracks me up.\tI never really understood why this book is so universally adored; sure, Holden is a slacker, the type of clown that every distraught kid envisions themselves to be, some gem in the rough with all the talent, but lacking the ambition to make a notable mark on the world which holds them back. But you grow up, if only to acknowledge you have no talents and still have no ambition, and instead of grabbing for that golden ring, you waste your time writing shitty reviews on shitty books here on goodreads on a ball-dampeningly warm Sunday afternoon. Come to think of it, that’s probably why so many appreciate this bumbling tale; like Holden, they probably equate themselves to that misshapen hunk of precious metal hidden beneath a untilled mound of Nebraskan soil, laying in wait for someone to unearth their sparkling brilliance for all the world to admire. Of course, when you realize Tucker Max probably felt the same way you immediately bathe in bromine and shave what remains of your flesh completely bald to scour the scourge as thoroughly as humanly possible. Perhaps it may be slightly  promising to delude yourself than resigning your life to the contemplation of just how lame you actually are.\tSo here’s a quick glimpse of what’s inspired so many lifelong laughingstocks. Here’s Holden fruitlessly swimming against the current, a complete nincompoop (let’s remember he’s Irish) who gets kicked out of school for being a moron and talks hard yet winds up getting the shit mercilessly beaten out of him by a crumby snob named Stradlater (a book about Studly Strad would have been far better) and a pimp named Maurice. Holden also feels the need to denounce everyone as a phony, though I find myself at a loss to imagine anything phonier than a wimpy, big-mouthed mick mollycoddled by daddy’s fat bankroll while attending prep school along with his stunning array of hand-crafted, Italian leather luggage. Let’s not gloss over the fact that Holden is probably impotent, as evidenced by his inability to lay the wood to Sally, Jane, or even a prostitute, perhaps his crowning disgrace. Either that or he’s queer, seeing as he duped poor Antolini by presenting his former mentor with the ultimate fantasy of a drunken, sexually-inexperienced youth with ‘no place to go’ and then, afraid that further action might expose his impotence, he felt the need to flee into the night, acting all startled about what just transpired. Let’s face it, Holden himself claims that similar ‘perverty’ stuff happened to him a lot as a kid, and then feigns shock when Antolini comes in to take a juicy bite of the bare bottom he so masterfully baited. All this weirdness coming from an awkward geek with a fondness for children ought to be enough to sway any who remain unconvinced thus far. You’re STILL not seeing the light?!? Seriously? Ok, last clue Caulfield is a deviant: the kid aspires to be a “catcher”. And this ‘catcher’ fantasy involves children. If you need further explanation I’ll be required to rent a jackhammer to pound the obvious into your skull.\tThis will hopefully be the last time that I read “The Catcher in the Rye”, as I’ve given it too many chances and always walked away completely disappointed. I will give Salinger's opus two stars, however, simply for the entertainment of laughing at it.",

If I wouldn't have known when the story was written, I would have guessed it only came out in the past couple of decades. So if the reason you haven't picked up this book is that you're afraid of having trouble with the obsolete words that are generally used in classics - don't worry, you'll be fine!There are many repetitive phrases, and I can totally understand why someone might find this annoying, but I personally really like things like that in books. I actually made it my mission to highlight every single line where the main character Holden mentions that \"something killed him\", he's feeling depressed/nervous/etc, something/someone is mad/a madman, something is (according to him) only \"sort of\" happening, something is relating to death in some way, and a couple of other little things...Boy, was I busy! There is something marked on every.single.page!So if you're someone that doesn't like repetition...yeah, it's save to say this book probably isn't for you.Now, while we're on the topic of Holden: I'm sure he is one of the most hated characters of all time, because I see and hear countless of people talking about how pretentious and irritating he is. I also understand those opinions, but I just absolutely fell in love with him!The reason for that is easy to find: I relate to him. I understand this anger and frustration at everything and everyone. I understand feeling like no matter what good happens to you, it just isn't enough and you still end up feeling lost and alone. If I had read this book a couple of years ago, I would have thought that Holden is pretty much a male version of me, and I would have thrown it in the faces of everybody who was helplessly trying to understand me. Thankfully, I have now moved passed this stage, and I can look at him and his (or  so: our previously shared) view of the world a bit  critically. But reading the book at the stage of my life were I am now, it also showed me that it's still far to easy for me to relate to and sympathize with characters like Holden. It made me realize that I've still got a long way to go. My ambition is to reread this book in ten years or so and only feel connected to Holden in a distant and long-passed way.Lastly, I'd like to mention that is a 100% character-driven book. There is only a very small amount of plot (and that small amount is rather generic). This is  of a character study, so if you're looking for a exciting tale filled with action and adventure - this is not the book for you.",

Salinger takes the reader on a ride through a few days of an adolescent’s life at the age of sixteen. Holden Caulfield has just been told that he’s flunked out of another preparatory school and must make the journey home to relay this to his parents. However, as this is not the first time, he is in no hurry to do so, and thus begins the meandering trip back to admit failure. In a narrative told from Caulfield’s perspective, the reader learns much about this boy as he wanders aimlessly around campus and eventually makes his way back to New York City. With a mixture of present-day happenings and tangential flashbacks, the reader sees Caulfield as a man who has seen much, but also knows very little. Salinger allows the slowly-developing narrative to continue, while Caulfield discovers just how much of the world is still unknown, all while he worries about how to tell his family the news that he is academically useless. By the time he reaches home, Caulfield has one last chance to shape his story, but even then, his younger sister steals the spotlight and recounts some of her own drama. Surely, this family loves being vapid and speaking in tangential styles that drown out any hope of understanding a topic at hand. Salinger must have a message here and literary critics found it, sipping from the proverbial Kool-Aid in droves. For me, it sets the bar quite low for what might be called classical literature. This may best be read with a glass of rye, for only then will you catch its meaning.I have long debated with people about what makes a novel “a classic”. Interestingly enough, no one can really tell me enough to sway my opinion. I am left to wonder if Salinger simply wrote at a time when it was ‘en vogue’ to be tangential and superficial, thus making this the cornerstone of something stellar. My father, who was an English teacher, would surely have some answers for me, though I am at a loss to think about how even he might help remove me from the paper bag in which I found myself. His passing years ago does little to help me now (and I am beginning to write tangentially, which is solely the fault of this book!). Holden Caulfield comes across as a typical teenage boy of the time (post-war), who is trying to make his mark on the world. He struggles with defining himself and those around him, wanting to fit in and yet differentiate himself significantly. While he accomplishes little on his meandering journey from school to the family home, Caulfield is able to show the reader that he has grit and determination, even if it comes across as less than important. Many of the others who cross paths with Caulfield serve as signposts in his narrative, wallflowers when he needs them to be and actively helping to formulate the story when necessary. I had little connection to any of them and found Salinger wanted it that way. The story was nothing worth noting and I am sure I will be scorned for missing many of the nuggets embedded into the tale. That said, when I hear classic, I expect much  than I got and while i cannot take away from J.D. Salinger, I am left to wonder if I was too sober and too grounded to accept this for what it should have been. It may not have been drivel, but the only classic aspect of it was that I was not forced to spend hours of my time for nothing.Kudos, Mr. Salinger, for being able to bask in the limelight. I missed the mark and I am sure others will educate me.

Eventually, when I did read The Magician's Nephew, I realized how hopelessly wrong I was. With The Catcher in the Rye, I'm faced with the same realization all over again.Some books are written so well, so masterfully that you are bound to get the message the writer had slipped in, skilfully, somewhere between its pages for the perceptive reader to find and cherish like treasure, only if you care to lay off the preordained feelings and biases.Sure, I agree, nothing ever happens in this book. The prose, in Holden's own overused words, can be described as 'boring' and insipid in my own. But that is what Salinger had wanted it to be.I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have liked Holden had I read this as a teen. I would've considered him a whiny, nitpicking pain in the rear. A kid trying to sound and behave like an adult and, of course, failing at it miserably. But now that I'm a full-fledged adult, capable of knowing what I want and what I don't, I can understand Holden much better. And I can't help but feel a sort of grudging respect for Holden's daring act of breaking away even if for a little while, from the compulsions and responsibilities that life threw his way, the expectations of peers and adults surrounding him.His voice is so full of recalcitrance, loneliness, resentment and all the amorphous emotions of that age, that it's near impossible not to relate to it. A sense of pure isolation, a feeling of being adrift in the big, bad world, sometimes with barely anything or anyone acting as an anchor. Faced with problems you previously did not even know existed, an ever-widening gap with the members of the opposite sex. A mass of confusing, blurry thoughts swirling inside your head that you would rather prefer to push away than disentangle one by one and analyze. Sometimes not being sure of what you want to do and what you are supposed to do. Stuck somewhere in a time-warp, on the brink of adulthood yet not quite so. Demanding to be treated with respect and dignity like an adult, yet to be loved as a child. I'm sure we have all gone through the same motions at some point of time in our lives.Holden reminds us of that period even if we may not see in him the teenager each one of us had been, individually. He is simply a personification of those confusing, bitter, hazy years that precede the surer, firmer,  secure years.And if we maybe honest enough with ourselves we'll find a Holden, all holed up somewhere in the darkest recesses of our psyche, eternally disdainful and critical of the people and things around him. It's just that we've gotten better at keeping 'him' hidden and swallowing urges to lash out at the 'phoniness' of it all. Holden's appeal is timeless. And I'm quite sure, I'll like this book when I read it again, years down the line. And for this reason alone, The Catcher in the Rye rightly deserves a place in the halls of classic American literature.This is THE YA novel. And, perhaps, will always be. P.S:- My love for this book is not to be interpreted as an endorsement of teenage delinquency or rebellious/anti-social behavior. ",

This book is a work of genius.The book is a \"coming of age\" tale, but it certainly transcends the adolescent garbage that fills up most of the genre. The protagonist is 16 year old Holden Caulfield - depressed, aimless, and disillusioned. The entire story covers just one December weekend in which he seeks to find direction in his life after flunking out of another prep school. As Caulfield contemplates his transition from adolescence to adulthood, he becomes disgusted with the utter \"phoniness\" of society and longs for the innocence of youth.Where Salinger's masterpieces surpasses other notable coming of age novels such as \"Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man\" and \"This Side of Paradise\" is in the treatment of social s. Where these other novels offer a one-dimensional treatment of sexuality and religious apostasy as the sum-all of maturation, Salinger offers a  complicated,  realistic picture. Caulfield's narrative certainly deals with sexuality, but he goes beyond the stock material of young man bucking sexual conventions. After first boasting about past sexual encounters, Caulfield admits he's actually a virgin. At an age in which sexual experience is a badge of honor for most young men, Caulfied decides that sex should be as much spiritual as physical and ought to be shared only with someone he really cares about. When his sexually experienced roommate goes out with an innocent childhood friend, Caulfield throws it down with the young man in protest against the perceived assault on innocence. Later, Caulfield accepts a prostitute into his room only to become depressed, pay the girl, and turn her out without accepting her services. The following day, Caulfield donates $10 to two humble nuns, the same amount paid to the whore the night before.Salinger's treatment of religion is equally nuanced and equally honest. While claiming to be \"practically an atheist,\" Caulfield also admits that he has a desire to pray. While disclaiming a belief in God, he occasionally asks what Christ would think about people's actions. In Caulfield's conflict, the reader sees a certain disgust with the phoniness of organized religion set against a sincere acceptance of Christ's actual message.So while this book shares with other novels a contempt for societal s, it is not a simple repudiation of religion in favor of unrestrained sexuality. Caulfield does reject most of the adult world he encounters as utterly \"phony,\" but he does not follow the stock pattern laid down by earlier modernists. Caulfield questions it all, perhaps despising Hollywood above everything else.So what does Caulfield accept after rejecting all of adult society? Childhood innocence. The only thing that makes this young man happy is spending time with children, his young sister most of all. Indeed, the section giving rise to the title of the work is a poignant plea for saving innocent children from the phoniness and corruption of the world.So for all the past scandal about the profanity and sexuality in this work, there is much to be admired by the secularist and the Christian alike. That's difficult to do, but Salinger pulls it off marvelously. Though we can't all agree what influences in society are corrupting, I think most everyone can agree that there is initially some purity that is corrupted.",
        "“What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though.”",
        "“Among other things, you'll find that you're not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior. You're by no means alone on that score, you'll be excited and stimulated to know. Many, many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now. Happily, some of them kept records of their troubles. You'll learn from them—if you want to. Just as someday, if you have something to offer, someone will learn something from you. It's a beautiful reciprocal arrangement. And it isn't education. It's history. It's poetry.”",

FUCK, life is so full of crap.there is one good thing in my life though. just read this book Catcher in the Rye. blown away! i don't know how a book written decades ago could say exactly what i would say. it is like the author was reading my thoughts and put it all down in this book. things i didn't even realize i felt were right there on the page! I LOVED IT. i think this is my favorite novel of all time. which is not saying a whole lot because there is a ton of pretentious bullshit out there and i bet mrs. durham will force us to read it all. man i hate that bitch.journal entrytoday i am 20 years old. life is great as usual. just enjoyed my wednesday morning wake-and-bake session with j-p, the sun is shining, the san diego weather is beautiful, and tonight i'm off to rob & gregg's to destroy them at bullshit. love that game! gregg says that joelle will be there (yes!) but she'll probably bring that prick pete with her. one of these days i'm going to lose it and kick his ass. \"i'm in a band\"...fuck you, pete! i will never spin your records.all i have on the agenda today is to go to the gym and then off to keracik's american lit class. it is not a bad class, although it is nowhere close to gender studies with halberstam. or davidoff's survey of modern postmodernism last semester. now that was a class! it blew my mind. so many things to think about. the reading in american lit has been okay. but we've been assigned to read Catcher in the Rye and it is terrible. can't believe i ever liked this book. caulfield is a whiny little bitch. the book has no depth. there is literally nothing going on with the narrative, style, theme, characterization, it is just one rote cliché after another. he thinks he is such a rebel-without-a-cause but in reality he is just another tired representation of rootless, stereotypical masculinity and gender essentialism. completely inane and without meaning. i think my essay will use some acker-style postmodernist techniques to show how simplistic this trite \"classic\" truly is. i'm going to deconstruct the shit out of this novel, baby!journal entrytoday i am 25 years old. another gray, drizzly san francisco morning. i wish christopher would wake up, i really need to talk to him after all that shit last night. notes on my pillow, really?? time to grow up dude, i will never \"complete you\". well actually i'm glad he's still asleep, my throat is too sore to get into it right now with him. plus Food Not Bombs is happening this morning and i have to get the kitchen ready. john is probably hard at work already, typical over-achieving behavior. i bet the wisconsin kids are still crashing on our living room floor. it's time for them to leave! they've seen The Vindictives at every single Epicenter or Gilman show now and it is time for them to hit the road. or learn to take a shower. this apartment is not the world's crashpad!i woke up early this morning and thumbed through A Catcher in the Rye. i remember hating this book in college for some reason. probably wasn't po-mo enough for me. or \"challenging\". feh. what a pretentious idiot i was. this is a beautiful book. it changed my life as a kid, i'm not sure how i would have survived orange county without it. just re-reading parts of it brought back all that old angst about all the fucked-up shit in the world that kids have to deal with. i'm not sure there is another book as insightful or as meaningful. or funny! that part with the clipping-of-the-toenails is hilarious. ackley is such a douche. this book is the foundation of every zine that i have ever loved. a perfect novel. it is so....\"human\", i guess.journal entrytoday i am 30 years old. man my head hurts...so hungover! my birthday party last night was awesome. even got to spend some time on the turntables (thanks kraddy for actually relinquishing a tiny bit of control for once). i must have made out with a half-dozen people. sadly, no real action. i think last night's party will be the last big party i will ever throw. things have got to change. no  partying like the world is about to end, i still have my entire life ahead of me! tomorrow i am going to go into AIG and hand in my notice. i am not an entertainment insurance underwriter, that is not me. fuck them. if erika can get me that job working with homeless kids at Hospitality House, than i am set. although moving from the biggest room in the flat to the water heater closet will be no fun. i'm 30 years old now for chrissakes! still, i've got to do something meaningful with my life. it cannot all be about booze, drugs, hooking up, and paying everyone's rent when they're broke. things have got to change.i cracked open A Catcher in the Rye yesterday before the party and read some of my favorite parts. what an inspiration! seriously, that is a classic novel. it is packed with meaning. i'm twice caulfield's age but i still somehow connect with him in a very direct way. my life is going to change and the attitude expressed in that book is at the heart of that change. i love you, holden caulfied. it's not too late for me to learn from you, to find some meaning in life.journal entrytoday i am 35 years old. another intense, sad, but deeply fulfilling week has passed. every day something meaningful happens, something so emotional and real. sometimes i find myself just losing it in a fetal position because of the things i've seen. working with people who are drug addicted or who have been abused or who are dying is HEAVY. but it is also beautiful. it's hard to believe i am dealing with all of that and supporting my folks too. thank God i have good friends to talk to about these things. anyway. so now marcy wants to have a kid. i just don't know how i feel about that. this is such a fucked up world, do we really want to bring new life into it? i dunno. it seems....selfish, somehow. she should just quit her job with the d.a.'s office and get back to her roots in the public defender's office instead. does she think that having a child with me will bring  meaning into her life? my life has meaning enough already. and i really am not sure i can handle that responsibility on top of everything else.i skimmed A Catcher in the Rye yesterday, after an awkward talk with marcy about having a baby. it was not an inspiring read. caulfield is so full of misplaced angst! i'm not sure i even understand him any. why is he so pissed off? he's seen nothing of the world and what the world can actually do to people. i want to like him, i want to re-capture that feeling of affection i had for him, but now his contempt and his anger just seem so meaningless, so naive. he really does not have it so bad. there is so much worse out there. i don't know how i would handle a kid like that. i hate to say it, but i constantly rolled my eyes when reading it. oh the emotional self-absorption of youth! just you wait, caulfield. it sure gets a hell of a lot  complicated once you grow up.journal entrytoday i am 40 years old. when did i become a boss? it is like i woke up one day, mysteriously transformed into an old man. am i really a \"leader\"? what does that even mean? sometimes i feel like i am just faking it all and someone is going to figure it out and blow the whistle on me. last week i made a huge play on the Council, i had all my ducks in a row, and all the votes came in just as i had planned. everyone has their own agenda and the way to get things done is simply to recognize and engage with that disappointing fact. some folks got up and started clapping and then the whole room joined in, even council members who voted against my motion - feh, phonies. the experience was sort of amazing but it also made me feel very odd, almost disconnected from myself. is this who i am now, a public policy figure, a community advocate, a mayoral appointee? ugh, i can't stand the mayor. i don't feel like me. there is accomplishment there, and some satisfaction... but i am missing something, something visceral, something real. sweet Jesus, is this what a mid-life crisis feels like? it is a weird feeling, like i know everything that i need to know about the world, about the people around me, how everything connects, but yet i still feel like i know so little about life. oh, such angst, mark. surely you've outgrown this?i've started re-reading A Catcher in the Rye. it's so strange, during different parts, i felt like crying. a wonderful and moving novel. i feel like i really understand holden, like he is my guide, my son, my brother, my friend... myself. i think of him and i know that change in the world and changing myself can still happen. it just has to happen. that's life after all, right?",

The thing with kids is, if they want to grab for the gold ring, you have to let them do it, and not say anything. If they fall off, they fall off, but it’s bad if you say anything to them.”p.211I’ll bet everyone is going to think that I’m just horsin’ around or trying to be all sexy talking like this.

I felt like hating Catcher in the Rye was my dirty little secret.Time passed, and my self-loathing mellowed.

However, having first read it almost 25 years ago, I knew I had to read it again before I could feel justified in actually reviewing it. Of course, I didn’t hold out much hope that my feelings would change and was expecting a fairly painful reading experiece. In fact, as I started reading, I was already thinking about what my amazingly insightful, completely “isn’t it cool to bash on the classics” 1 star review was going to focus on. I thought maybe I could bag on the less than spectacular prose used by Salinger (making myself feel really smart in the process). Or maybe I could take some jabs at the less than exciting narrative pacing (and throw in a few references to \"watching paint dry\"). In the end, I thought my most likely avenue for attacking reviewing this anthem of teen angst was that it was utterly yawn inspiringno longer relevant today because of the GLUT of teen angst that the recent generations have been exposed to ad nauseam growing up. I mean we live in a time in which teen angst is EVERYWHERE and even has its own sub-genre label now. You can find it in:MUSIC............MOVIES...........AND EVEN THE SHITTY POPULAR LITERATURE*** OF OUR TIMES... *** Literature is a serious stretch, but I must admit that these books do IN FACT fill me with ANGST!!!...So what happened to all of the preconceived notions I had before I starting reading this book? Instead, I found myself completely drawn into the rich, nuanced story of Holden Caulfield. I found myself empathizing with Caulfield almost from the beginning (something I did not expect to do). His \"annoying\", \"pseudo rebellious\" and \"just don't care\" exterior were so obviously manufactured and so patently hiding a seriously sad and lost boy that I was transfixed on finding the real Holden Caulfield. Despite the book being written \"in Holden's own words\" the reader was still able to discern that Holden's surface response to a situation was hiding a much deeper, emotional resposne. For Salinger to be able to infuse that kind of nuance into the sparse prose of Caulfield’s narrative was nothing short of brilliant in my opinion. Caulfied is lazy. He is stubborn. He is immature. He is unfocused. He is untruthful. He is dangerously short-sighted and he is lost in his own world or unrealistic expectations. Sounds like that could certainly be a not unsubstantial portion of the male 16 year old population. However, after reading this book, I learned a few other things about Holden that I though were fascinating and that are not as often discussed:1.\tHe is desperately lonely (he even goes so far as ask his cab drivers to join him for a drink);2.\tHe is generous with his time and his things (he writes an essay for his roommate despite being upset with him and even lets him borrow his jacket); 3.\tHe is extremely sensitive and longs for an emotional (rather than just a physical) commitment (he mentions several times his need to “be in love” in order to be physical and his experience with the prostitute certainly bears this out);4.\tHe is intelligent (despite being lazy and unfocused, Holden displays great insight and intelligence regarding books he has read and displays at the museum); and 5.\tDespite being unable to process it correctly, he is full of compassion and has a deep capacity for love, which he shows most notably for his sister (this was one of the most powerful parts of the story for me as it was Holden’s desire to avoid hurting Phoebe that keeps him from running away at the end of the book).  Taking all of the good and the bad together, I was left with the feeling that Holden is an adolescent on the cusp of adulthood who is achingly afraid of the loss of his childhood and the responsibility and commitment that he sees as required to make it in the “adult” world. He is compassionate, intelligent and deeply emotional and yet is unable (or unwilling) to focus that energy on those steps that he sees as leading him away from his “happy memories of childhood” and closer to the “scary world of the adult.” I think this is superbly shown in Holden's expressed dream of wanting to being the “Catcher in the Rye.” Quick side note: I had no idea what the title to the book referred to until I just read the book. Here is a person so afraid of growing up and so averse to giving into the pain and sadness that he sees as the result of becoming an adult that he wants nothing  than to spend his life protecting others from losing the innocence of childhood. Big, crazy, “I want to save the world” dreams are a wonderful part of childhood and it is a shame that such ideas and beliefs are too often destroyed under the barrage of “you really need to grow up” rather than having such dreams transitioned and re-focused into daring the improbable within the world of the possible.

I suppose I've understood for some time now that The Catcher in the Rye -- a favorite of mine when I was sixteen -- was a favorite precisely because I was sixteen. At sixteen, I found Holden Caulfield's crisis profoundly moving; I admired his searing indictment of society, his acute understanding of human nature, his extraordinary sensitivity (I mean, come on, he had a nervous breakdown for God's sake, he had to be sensitive). At sixteen, I wanted to marry Holden Caulfield. At forty, I want to spank him. After all, Holden's indictment of society boils down to the \"insight\" that everybody is a phony. That's the kind of insight a sixteen year old considers deep. A forty year old of the grown-up variety recognizes Holden's insight as superficial and banal, indulging in the cheapest kind of adolescent posturing. It suggests a grasp of society and of human nature that's about as complex as an episode of Dawson's Creek. Holden and his adolescent peers typically behave as though the fate they have suffered (disillusionment and the end of innocence) is unique in human history. He can't see beyond the spectacle of his own disillusionment (and neither can J. D. Salinger); for all his painful self-consciousness, Holden Caulfield is not really self-aware. He can't see that he himself is a phony. Compare Salinger's novel of arrested development, for instance, with a real bildungsroman, Great Expectations. Holden Caulfield is an adolescent reflecting on childhood and adolescence; Pip Pirrip is an adult reflecting on childhood and adolescence. Holden Caulfield has the tunnel vision of teendom, and he depicts events with an immediacy and absorption in the experience that blocks out the broader context, the larger view. Pip Pirrip has the wonderful double vision of a sensitive adult recollecting the sensitive child he used to be; he conveys at the same time the child's compelling perspective and the adult's thoughtful revision of events. While Holden Caulfield litters his narrative with indignant exposes of phonies and frauds, Pip Pirrip skillfully concentrates on \"the spurious coin of his own make\" -- that is, without letting the child Pip and the adolescent Pip in on the joke, he exposes himself as a phony. Pip Pirrip grows up. Holden Caulfield has a nervous breakdown. I suppose the only reason I begrudge him his breakdown is that so many in our culture -- many , unfortunately, than just the legitimate adolescents among us -- seem fixated on Holden as a symbol of honesty and socially-liberating rebellion. We view nervous collapse and dysfunction as a badge of honor, a sign -- to put it in Caulfieldian terms -- that we are discerning enough to see through all the crap. Our celebration of overwrought disaffection reminds me of the last sentence of Joyce’s Araby: “Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger.” Here is the adolescent pose non-pareil. Equally self-accusing and self-aggrandizing, it captures the adolescent at the precise moment when his own disillusionment becomes the object of his grandiose and self-dramatizing vision. That’s the kind of crap that Holden Caulfield (and J. D. Salinger) cannot see through. And it is often the kind of crap that we “adults” like to slosh around in. The Barney beating of several years ago is another symptom of our arrested adolescence, our inability to ride the wave of disillusion into the relatively calm harbor of adulthood -- as though flailing around in the storm and raging at the wind were in themselves marks of distinction and a superior sensibility. I remember a news story about a woman in a Barney costume being seriously injured when a rabid (and probably drunken) anti-Barney fanatic attacked the big purple dinosaur at some public event. Now, I don’t know the age of the Barney-beater, but the act itself is a supremely adolescent one, in which the impulsive response to disillusionment is to lash out at those symbols of childhood which made the biggest dupes of us. At the dawn of adolescence, when Barney begins to appear cloying and false, it seems natural to want to beat up on him, as though it was Barney himself who pulled one over on us instead of our own poignant and necessary misapprehension of the nature of things. I could see Holden Caulfield beating up on Barney (at least rhetorically), and I could see Holden Caulfield missing Barney (as he misses all the “phonies” at the end of the book), but I cannot see Holden Caulfield accepting the postlapsarian Barney on new terms, as a figure who is meant for children and not for him. For all his touching poses about wanting to be the “catcher in the rye,” what Holden really wants is not to save children but to be a child again.",

        "Sometimes truth isn't just stranger than fiction, it's also  interesting and better plotted. Salinger helped to pioneer a genre where fiction was deliberately less remarkable than reality.

Salinger helped to pioneer a genre where fiction was deliberately less remarkable than reality. His protagonist says little, does little, and thinks little, and yet Salinger doesn't string Holden up as a satire of deluded self-obsessives, he is rather the epic archetype of the boring, yet self-important depressive.I've taken the subway and had prolonged conversations on the street with prostitutes (not concerning business matters), and I can attest that Salinger's depiction is often accurate to what it feels like to go through an average, unremarkable day. However, reading about an average day is no  interesting than living one.Beyond that, Salinger doesn't have the imagination to paint people as strangely as they really are. Chekhov's 'normal' little people seem  real and alive than Salinger's because Chekhov injects a little oddness, a little madness into each one. Real people are almost never quite as boring as modernist depictions, because everyone has at least some ability to surprise you.Salinger's world is desaturated. Emotions and moments seep into one another, indistinct as the memories of a drunken party. Little importance is granted to events or thoughts, but simply pass by, each duly tallied by an author in the role of court reporter.What is interesting about this book is not that it is realistically bland, but that it is artificially bland. Yet, as ridiculous a concept as that is, it still takes itself entirely in earnest, never acknowledging the humor of its own blase hyperbole.This allows the book to draw legions of fans from all of the ridiculously dull people who take themselves as seriously as Holden takes himself. They read it not as a parody of bland egotism but a celebration, poised to inspire all the bland egotists who have resulted from the New Egalitarianism in Art, Poetry, Music, and Academia.Those same folks who treat rationality and intellectual fervor like a fashion to be followed, imagining that the only thing required to be brilliant is to mimic the appearance and mannerisms of the brilliant; as if black berets were the cause of poetic inspiration and not merely a symptom.One benefit of this is that one can generally sniff out pompous faux intellectuals by the sign that they hold up Holden as a sort of messianic figure. Anyone who marks out Holden as a role-model is either a deluded teen with an inflated sense of entitlement, or is trying to relive the days when they were.But what is  interesting is that those who idolize Holden tend to be those who most misunderstand him. Upon close inspection, he's not depressive, not consumed with ennui or an existential crisis, he's actually suffering from 'Shell Shock'--now known as 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder'.The way he thinks about his brother's and classmate's deaths--going over the details again and again in his mind, but with no emotional connection--it's not symptomatic of depression, but of psychological trauma. He is stuck in a cycle, unable to process events, going over them again and again, but never able to return to normalcy.It takes a certain kind of self-centered prick to look at someone's inability to cope with the reality of death and think \"Hey, that's just like my mild depression over how my parents won't buy me a newer ipod!\" It's not an unusual stance in American literature--there's an arrogant detachment in American thought which has become less and less pertinent as the world grows and changes. As recently as The Road we have American authors comparing a difficult father-son relationship to the pain and turmoil of an African civil war survivor--and winning awards for displaying their insensitive arrogance.Perhaps it's time we woke up and realized that the well-fed despondence of the white man should not be equated with a lifetime of death, starvation, war, and traumas both physical and emotional. And as for Salinger--a real sufferer of Post-Traumatic Stress who was one of the first soldiers to see a concentration camp, who described how you can never forget the smell of burning flesh--I can only imagine how he felt when people read his story of a man, crippled by the thought of death, and thought to themselves \"Yes, that's just what it's like to be a trustafarian with uncool parents\". No wonder he became a recluse and stopped publishing.",
        "J.D. Salinger’s ‘Catcher in the Rye’ was published on July 16, 1951. It was his first novel. It became very popular among young adolescents yet not so popular with older generations. I personally thoroughly enjoyed every part of this book. I felt very close to Holden Caulfield, the main character in the story, as I read it. Holden Caulfield, a sixteen year old boy from New York, was quite unlike kids his age. He had no interest in being popular or social. From the very beginning he lets us into J.D. Salinger’s ‘Catcher in the Rye’ was published on July 16, 1951. It was his first novel. It became very popular among young adolescents yet not so popular with older generations. I personally thoroughly enjoyed every part of this book. I felt very close to Holden Caulfield, the main character in the story, as I read it. Holden Caulfield, a sixteen year old boy from New York, was quite unlike kids his age. He had no interest in being popular or social. From the very beginning he lets us into part of his personal life. His parents are very touchy and his mother is especially protective. It becomes clear very quickly where Holden’s interests lie and where they start to veer off. He tends to lean away from the fake in the world and is a teller of what is real. Holden is not a fan of the movies at all. He saw his brother, D.B., throw away his natural writing talent all for a large Hollywood check. Any other boy Holden’s age would have been absolutely ecstatic to have a sibling working amongst the stats in Hollywood, but not Holden. It was all far too “phony” for him; and phony is his worst enemy. Salinger’s use of sarcasm and irony is beautiful and hilarious. As I read through each chapter I found myself highlighting funny, sarcastic things Holden would say or think (and trust me, there are DOZENS of time where this occurs.) One specific time in Chapter 8 he is talking to a cab driver who is acting like a real fool. Holden says to the readers, “He certainly was good company. Terrific personality.” Salinger’s character Holden is actually a lot like Salinger in his real life. Like Holden, Salinger was known for his reclusive nature. Uninterested with the fakeness of the world, Holden keeps his distance from phony people. After Salinger’s success of ‘The Catcher in the Rye’, he slowed down his publishing and slowly but surely drifted out of the public eye. To this day Salinger refuses any offers to have ‘The Catcher’ put on the big Hollywood screen. Salinger’s ex lover, Joyce Maynard, even once said that, “The only person who might ever have played Holden Caulfield would have been J.D. Salinger.” It seems to me that it is no coincidence that Holden is no fan of Hollywood and that Salinger in real life and doesn’t want anything to do with turning his popular novel into a movie. Holden says, “If there’s one thing I hate, it’s the movies, Don’t even mention them to me.”Since I have learned  about Salinger’s personal life, I recognize a lot of Salinger’s personality in Holden. In the story, Holden has overbearing parents much like Salinger’s parents. Salinger said his mother was over protective. Salinger has one sibling, a sister, which is ironic because it is Holden’s sister Phoebe who has a profound influence on Holden. He often talks about her with very high regards.Holden is not a character who tried to sugarcoat the way he sees the fakeness around him. Holden, making fun of the people around him, often says things like “you would’ve puked” and “it was very phony”. I think that is another one of the reasons I like his character so much. For example, he is quite upset with the fact that his brother D.B. is selling his work to Hollywood instead of using his talents for his own pleasure. Holden even says that his brother is his favorite author. Salinger himself is a man who wrote for his own pleasure and likeness. I made a similar connection to a girl named Sally that Holden likes in the book, to a real life lover of Salinger’s named Oona. Oona O’Neil was self-absorbed and stuck up, according to Salinger, yet he still phoned and wrote her letters quite often. Holden’s “Oona” in the story was a girl named Sally Hayes. Though he found her extremely irritating he thought she was very attractive as well. After spending a day with her, he pointed out about a dozen instances where he thought she was being “phone as hell”. By the end of their only meeting in the book, Holden says to Sally, “You give me a royal pain in the ass if you want to know the truth.” The real life Oona O’Neil ended up breaking it off with Salinger and married the famous actor, Charlie Chaplin.Despite Holden being a sixteen year old teenage boy he acts much older than his age. One time in the story he has the chance to be with a prostitute but instead of acting like a pig, he starts to feel sorry for her and instead tried to have a conversation with her. He even offers to pay her for good conversation instead of for sex. He also stays alone in hotels randomly, drinks at bars and clubs often, and even tells people he’s older than he really is. But the reason I find his character mature and intellectual is for other reasons.Holden does not hold money or material things to be really important. He is  excited to hang out with his kid sister than he is any other time in the entire book. He is content with something that would probably be boring to other guys his age.Like many teenagers, Holden is often depressed. The way he deals with it most times actually breaks my heart in a way. He likes to talk to his deceased kid brother, Allie. He will take a real event that he can remember where he was talking with him and pretend he is talking to him again. He says, “I started talking out loud to Allie. I do that sometimes when I get very depressed.” It is really very heart wrenching to hear Holden talk about his brother. One of my favorite moments in the book is when Holden and Phoebe are talking in Phoebe’s room and she points out that Holden doesn’t like anything. Holden responds quickly by saying, “I like Allie. And I like doing what I’m doing right now. Sitting here with you and talking and thinking about stuff…” Phoebe says to Holden, “Allie’s dead-you always say that! If somebody’s dead and everything, and in heaven then it isn’t really--”. Holden interrupts her with his final comeback, “I know he’s dead! Don’t you think I know that? I can still like him, though, can’t I? just because somebody’s dead, you don’t just stop liking them, for God’s sake- especially if they were about a thousand times nicer than the people you know that’re alive and all.”One of the most beautiful things about ‘The Catcher in the Rye’ is the way Salinger uses symbolism. From Holden’s red hunting hat, to Jane Gallagher’s checker playing technique, Salinger wrapped up  than meets the eye into things you never would have dreamed. The main thing that drew me into this story is the realness of Holden’s character. He is a teenage boy with a teenage boy’s mind but seems to have far  common sense than anyone else around him. He is not a jock. He is not a math whiz or a science whiz. He is not really interested in sports. He sort of makes up his own category; a category that I call ‘the genuine’. He is on his own a lot and loves it at first, but happiness and love are meant to be shared with others. It has a much less meaning when by itself and he realizes it by the end of the novel. He is growing intellectually little by little throughout the whole book. He realizes what really makes him happy. I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone and everyone who would like to read a story that could possibly change the way they view the world. I have honestly laughed outloud to myself as I read this story. Yes, there is talk about drinking, sex, and lots of cussing, but if you are going to avoid reading this story because of that then your missing out on a beautiful masterpiece. ",

That is easily one of the saddest, most pathetic introductions to a book. As I started this book, I wondered... if the introduction is like this, how will the rest of the book be?This is what the rest of the book looked like:\"He was also the nicest, in lots of ways. He never got mad at anybody. People with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily, but Allie never did, and he had very red hair. I'll tell you what kind of red hair he had.\" \"I sort of used to go to Allie's baseball matches.\"\"It was around ten-thirty, I guess, when I finished it.\" I can imagine Holden as this very insipid, boring little kid with no life in him whatsoever. Also, Holden thinks everyone besides him is a phony and a moron. And he makes it very clear because he mentions it, like, every two pages. Literally... every damn time. I read some of the comments regarding how I didn't understand this book because I didn't relate to it. That may be true. Very, very true. Regardless, I still think to this day that this book is a drag and has an unlikable main character and a dry, boring writing style. Perhaps I will read it again when I am older and maybe I'll enjoy it. ",

SalingerThe Catcher in the Rye is a 1951 novel by J. D. Salinger. Holden Caulfield, a teenager from New York City, is living in an unspecified institution in southern California near Hollywood in 1951. Story of Holden Caulfield with his idiosyncrasies, penetrating insight, confusion, sensitivity and negativism. The hero-narrator of \"The Catcher in the Rye\" is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices -- but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: بار نخست ماه آگوست سال 1982 میلادی، بار دوم در سال 2001 میلادی و سومین بار در ماه ژوئن سال 2005 میلادیعنوان: ناطور دشت؛ نویسنده: جروم دیوید (جی.د.) سالینجر؛ مترجم: احمد کریمی؛ تهران، فرانکلین، 1345؛ در 354 ص؛ چاپ دیگر: تهران، اشرفی، 1371؛ چاپ دیگر: تهران، ققنوس، 1381؛ در 326 ص؛ شابک: 9643112543؛ چاپ چهارم 1385؛ چاپ پنجم: تهران، علمی، فرهنگی، 1386؛ در 326 ص؛ شابک: 9789643112547؛ چاپ ششم 1387؛ چاپ هفتم 1388، هشتم 1389؛ سال 1393 ؛ چاپ دیگر: 1393؛ در 256 ص؛ شابک: 9786001215930؛ موضوع: نوجوانان فراری - داستانهای نویسندگان امریکایی - سده 20 معنوان: ناتور دشت؛ مترجم: محمد نجفی؛ تهران، نیلا، 1378، در 296 ص؛ چاپ چهارم 1381؛ چاپ پنجم 1384 در 207 ص؛ هفتم 1388؛ هشتم 1389؛ چاپ نهم 1393؛داستان جوانی جسور و جستجوگر، در پی مفهوم زندگی. «هولدن کالفیلد:، نوجوانی هفده ساله، که در آغاز رمان، در یک مرکز درمانی بستری است، و ظاهراً قصد دارد، آن‌چه که پیش از رسیدن به مرکز درمانی را، از سر بگذرانده، برای کسی بازگو کند، همین ‌کار را هم می‌کند. رمان بر همین پایه شکل می‌گیرد. در زمان رخداد رویدادهای داستان، «هولدن» یک پسر بچه ی شانزده‌ ساله‌ است، که در مدرسه ی شبانه‌ روزی «پنسی»، درس می‌خواند، و در آستانه ی کریسمس، به علت ضعف تحصیلی، از دبیرستان اخراج میشود، و باید به خانه‌ شان در «نیویورک» برگردد. همه ی رویدادهای داستان، طی سه روز، که «هولدن»، از مدرسه، برای رفتن به خانه خارج می‌شود، رخ می‌دهند. او می‌خواهد: «تا نامه ی مدیر، مبنی بر اخراجش، به دست پدر و مادرش برسد، و آب‌ها از آسیاب بیفتد به خانه ی خویش پا نگذارد». به همین ‌خاطر از زمانیکه از مدرسه خارج ‌میشود، دو روز را به سرگردانی سپری می‌کند. این دو روز نمادی است، از سفر «هولدن»، از کودکی به دنیای جوانی. رمان اصلی در سال 1951 میلادی منتشر شده، برگردان فارسی رمان، یعنی همین کتاب با عنوان: «ناطور دشت»، با ترجمه ی جناب «احمد کریمی»، در دهه ی پنجاه هجری خورشیدی منتشر گردیده است. سپس برگردان دیگری با عنوان: «ناتور دشت»، با ترجمه ی حناب: «محمد نجفی»، در دهه ی هفتاد هجری خورشیدی نیز منتشر شده است. ا. شربیانی",

Count the number of times he lies or behaves like someone he's not and then try to convince me otherwise. This is not a book about teenage alienation.

There really aren’t many choices available, and we are certainly sheltered from a lot of the harder parts of life. It seems like children don’t feel the need for meaning quite like adults do- maybe because they aren’t forced to face the daily grind. There’s boredom, but that is not what I am talking about. Kids don’t really have to compromise like adults do. As you enter adulthood you could start to see things and people as phony or fake. Maybe not people, but certain tasks or events certainly are. There’s a constant struggle in all of us between the meaningful and the mundane; the temporary and the eternal. There is a conflict, simply of time and energy. We desire the intentional and struggle towards spirituality; all while trying to earn a paycheck, wash our dishes, and sleep each night. It kind of reminds me of what I picture an AA meeting to look like. I think, rarely could someone find a place where people are  vulnerable, open, and honest with each other. Even if they win over addiction… how could life ever feel as full after that brief moment shared with others who completely understand? At the same time, the point of those meetings is to help people live- not just free from drugs, but maybe free to live in the mundane? Free to enjoy the dance of life, the needs of the soul balanced with the chores too. This doesn’t have to be depressing, but it does require compromise- or a sense of a time and place for everything- including the day-to-day.Catcher in the rye touches on some of these questions. Holden struggles with growing up. He sees everything as meaningless and adults as predictable and fake. I think he is mourning the loss of his innocence… maybe not just right from wrong, but the loss of dreams growing up seems to require. Holden, while at the museum that is exactly the same as it was when he was a kid says he likes it, because each time you visit \"the only thing that would be different would be you…\" and goes on to say \"certain things they should stay the way they are. You ought to be able to stick them in one of those big glass cases and just leave them alone. I know that's impossible, but it’s too bad anyway.\" One thing I thought of to help explain Holden's struggle with growing up is this: Coffee. When I was a kid, I used to smell my dad's coffee- that strong sugary-sweet smell of roasted beans. You wait for your chance to be let in on this excellent secret. Thinking it is just the caffeine that is preventing your parents from giving you a taste. Finally, they do and then all your dreams of that sweet flavor come crashing down! It's wrecked! Coffee isn't at all what you thought it was! That is, until the day you give it another chance, you start to be able to smell and taste the different tones coffee has. You can appreciate it for its varied, and almost living flavors. You see… Coffee isn't bad- it just wasn't what you always thought. The key is in finding the hidden flavors and getting over the fact that it will never taste as sweet as it smells. I think Holden struggled with the initial shock, that although life is  bitter than it \"smells\", or than you think it will be, there are the hidden joys and sweet flavors that make it almost better!This book doesn’t really set out to answer any of the questions it raises. Holden experiences the extremes of entering into adulthood and relates it in a way everyone, maybe especially, teenagers can understand. He is a flawed character who is desperate and depressed. As the reader, you can see why he feels the way he does, as he explains it so well you almost feel it with him. However, you can also see the flaws in his thinking. The author doesn't romanticize Holden's life, you don't read it thinking he has some special key to life that we all need. You simply feel his struggle to fit in and hope eventually he can learn to play the game and see the beauty that is there, hidden a little.",
        "Okay. So it's like this. My not-just-GR-friend-but-very-real-friend brian called and told me that J.D. Salinger had died maybe about a half hour ago (as I begin this 'review'). This sounds immensely absurd, pathetically sentimental, and embarrassing to admit, but I'm glad I heard it from him and not from some animatronic talking head with chin implants and immobile hair on the nightly news or from an obnoxiously matter-of-fact internet blurb, commenting like a machine on how Holden Caulfield hasOkay. So it's like this. My not-just-GR-friend-but-very-real-friend brian called and told me that J.D. Salinger had died maybe about a half hour ago (as I begin this 'review'). This sounds immensely absurd, pathetically sentimental, and embarrassing to admit, but I'm glad I heard it from him and not from some animatronic talking head with chin implants and immobile hair on the nightly news or from an obnoxiously matter-of-fact internet blurb, commenting like a machine on how Holden Caulfield has lately become less relevant to Generation Y or Z or AA or whatever stupid generation we're up to now. At first when brian told me, I thought, 'Oh, well... He was old. He was (probably) batshit crazy anyway. It was his time to check out, I guess.' Really. What difference does it make? He's been dead to the world since the mid-1960s. Before I was even born. A strong case could be made that he truly died in spirit when he started stalking Elaine Joyce on the set of 1980s sitcom Mr. Merlin. And yet... I still clung to this (still technically living) legend as if he were some kind of talisman I could wear around my neck, a good luck charm to ward off phonies and all manner of soulless dreck who populate this despicable world, writing 'fuck' on grammar school walls (and metaphorical equivalents). After returning for a few minutes to my soul-deadening job, which -- when you really get right down to it -- is just another way of killing time until I join Salinger in oblivion, I started getting all funny-feeling about it. At the risk of sounding like an adult contemporary power ballad written by Jim Steinman, with synthesized violins in the background, I began to feel as if my adolescence had finally come to an end. I guess it's about time. I'm thirty-eight years old, and yet I look at the people who are my age -- hell, who are even much younger than I am -- and who appear in all particulars to be adults, and I grow frightened/alarmed that they've graduated to the 'next level': they're mating and spawning and drawing up wills and completing their own tax returns and investing money and dealing (gracefully -- or with stoicism?) with the deaths of friends and relatives... and even some of them have died themselves of terrible diseases -- the kinds of diseases which are not content with merely claiming lives but which demand the optimal human suffering (the optimal dehumanization) before they cash in. So of course. I love all of Salinger's writing, but his value in my life has far surpassed that of a 'mere' literary pastime. He has kept me company for many years when I felt left behind by the exigencies of time and the claims of 'maturity.' In my head, I still picture myself as a nineteen-year-old, and I'm shocked again and again when somehow every other moron on the planet seems to be under the ridiculous impression that I'm a thirty-eight-year-old man. With graying hair. And deepening crow's feet. What idiots!I know all of this shit I'm saying is cliché, cliché, cliché. Lots and lots of people feel a special connection to Salinger's writing -- for just the reasons I described -- and lots and lots of people hate his writing because they find it grating and immature (Catcher in the Rye) or pretentious and ponderous (the Glass family stories). But I felt compelled to commemorate today in some way -- however trite and superfluous -- because I sense again and again (with the relatively recent deaths of some of my heroes, like Ingmar Bergman and Jacques Derrida, for instance) that I am entering a world that is no longer safeguarded by the great men and women of the elder generation; I am entering a world in which I am now the elder... with my own responsibilities and obligations. Yes, this still frightens me, but I'll always have Salinger's very particular and empathetic world to which to retreat when I have sacrificed too much of myself to a real world I'll never completely understand or feel at home in.",

It's not even helpful, realistic, smart, beneficial ...\" The answer is that the teenager is in a state of transition, moving from the relatively defined environment of childhood to the jungle of the adult world, and completely without tools to handle that journey. Using swearwords, trying different ways to tune out reality, not doing what one is supposed to do, those are all different methods of practicing the BIG SCARE. Growing up. Facing responsibility. Soon, soon, soon ... the teenager will have to earn money, make decisions, take care of others. And the weight is heavy on the young shoulders. Roaming the streets relaxes nerves. But still. There is an element of idealism in most teenagers' hearts. They don't usually want to fall into the traps of conventional evil. They want to change the world, make a difference. They are just struggling to come up with ideas how to do that, as their experience is limited. And they can't put their ideas into a wider context either. So being a catcher in the rye may make sense. It isn't necessarily the teenager's fault if nobody turns up where they wait to save lives, right? Teenage intentions are  often than not good. The results vary though.And their verbal skills are developing in conjunction with their minds as well:\"Happily, some of them kept records of their troubles. You'll learn from them—if you want to.

It's poetry.\"Teenage minds are indeed  poetry than prose: fractured, fragmented, emotional, in the moment, beautiful and fleeting.

But I think that doesn't quite get to the heart of it. Holden is a fifteen-year-old kid on the verge of an emotional breakdown. He's an asshole. He's a liar. He's a hypocrite. And he's also... really relatable. See, as a preteen, I struggled with severe emotional issues. I had depression and anxiety, although I didn't know it yet. I was going through major emotional issues with my parents, ones far worse than teen angst. I was on the lowest rung of the social pole at school. And God, I was an asshole. I was whiny and I was a hypocrite. I knew it, too, and I cried myself to sleep thinking about it. In the daylight, I told myself everyone else was terrible and that's why my world was falling apart. I was just as hypocritical and torn up inside as Holden is. Holden is an asshole, granted. But he is an asshole that it's hard not to relate to. So all this is to say that I completely understand why so many hated this book. But it resonates with me, and with so many people I know, for the exact reason that it will be polarizing. This is the kind of book that's going to be incredibly divisive. This is the kind of book that should maybe be taught by a teacher who loves it (thanks, 9th grade English teacher who hated me.) And this is the kind of book that sticks in my head, a year after I first read it. VERDICT: I really do recommend this, even knowing at least half its readership will despise it. It's truly worth the read. ",

Because - oh the horror! - they dare to focus on the readers' opinion rather than the coveted by conglomerates endorsements of THE PRODUCT. Because for some of us literature does not equal product. Because for some of us, literature is what is designed to make us think and speak up, and not mindlessly consume (consumer instead of reader - that's making me shudder).But first I WILL digress (and it seems I already have). And Holden Caulfield, the conflicted rebel with all the makings of a phony of the kind he detests, would probably approve. And if Holden approves, who the hell cares if Goodreads or Amazon do? “It’s this course where each boy in class has to get up in class and make a speech. You know. Spontaneous and all. And if the boy digresses at all, you’re supposed to yell ‘Digression!’ at him as fast as you can. It just about drove me crazy. I got an F in it.”“Why?”“Oh, I don’t know. That digression business got on my nerves. I don’t know. The trouble with me is, I like it when somebody digresses. It’s  interesting and all.”..........................You can't really love The Catcher in the Rye if you are feeling happy and content. At least I can't. When I'm happy, all I see is a moody overly judgmental privileged teenager looking for reasons to bitch about the world and being immature and a phony. I have to feel some discontent to appreciate the hiding behind that facade helpless anger, pain, loss and a rebellious streak. Holden is - or at least sometimes unsuccessfully trying to be - a rebel. A troublemaker. A square peg in a round hole. (Yes, I am very aware I'm quoting the Apple commercial. So sue me. Maybe it's off-topic or something. You decide.)And right now I am not happy and content seeing the site I used to love heading down the road that is perilous at best. The road that clearly shows preference towards consumers over readers. The consumerism mantra of buy-buy-buy is taking precedence over think-disagree-discuss-passionately argue-watch the truth being born. Holden Caulfield would not approve of such change in direction. And neither do I or so many people I have come to respect, people whose opinions help me discover the works of literature that I love.Holden Caulfield's views and his expression of them were, admittedly, often juvenile, poorly thought-through and frequently just as phony as those of people he reviles. He was quick to jump to judgment, ignoring those who really cared for him. He was prejudiced, snobbish and arrogant, and a habitual liar, too. How often do the readers want to reach into the book and shake some sense into this boy spiraling down into desperation and a breakdown?And yet there is something about the unhappy rebellious teenager that still resonates with us despite the obvious flaws. It is his anger itself, the rage against the world that is fake and all about appearances, about the power imbalance, about the smugness the powerful of this world carry with them. His emotions are so raw and so sincere that I may disagree with some of them but I sure as hell can't ignore them.As we probably all know too well, The Catcher in the Rye has been one of the most challenged books of the 20th century, riling up the emotions and protests of the wannabe censors who thought it was their sacred duty to shield and protect the public from the work of literature that dared to offend their tender sensibilities. These self-appointed sensors were (quite ironically, if you think about it) trying to be nothing less than the self-appointed Catchers in the Rye, protecting our childlike innocence from falling prey to The Catcher in the Rye. What they fail to grasp is that the point of the book itself is that such seemingly noble efforts are useless, worthless, and quite phony in their presumptuousness of knowing what's best; that these efforts are a slippery slope that is futile and dangerous.Just as it is equally presumptuous and patronizing and dangerous for any power to tell book readers there is a proper way to express their opinions, that they need to stay ON TOPIC (or else there will be a delete-button action equal to the shriek of 'Digression!' gleefully coming from Holden's classmates). Playing self-appointed Catcher in the Rye to the delicate sensibilities of certain bookselling sites, entitled writers or a bunch of offended fans, shifting the focus from discussing literature to reviewing product and collecting data - all this is just as misguided as Holden's futile efforts of saving children from growing up.You see, this is what I love about Salinger's so often contested work - its ability to stir thoughts and opinions that go beyond the plot and the book report and make you think, and maybe -just maybe - be a touch rebellious, too. This is dangerous, in the best meaning of this word, the meaning that makes all the self-appointed censors uneasy. These censors would rather have everyone toe the line and do what's expected and never have to face anything that even remotely upsets delicate sensibilities.  But Holden Caulfield goes on being subversive. And occasionally being off topic - and that's perfectly fine by me. \"Oh, I don’t know. That digression business got on my nerves. I don’t know.

Also, I’d probably have to take the time to learn how to italicize things on GoodReads, which would probably be worthwhile, but my computer skills could easily be outshone by a resuscitated troglodyte fresh from an ice-block. Added to that, I don’t know how long I could go on trying to poorly mimic the book without wanting to puke, I mean, not only is it a crumby thing to do to, but it’s also phony as hell.\tSo what do I think about the madman exploits of old Holden Caufield, perhaps one of the most acclaimed protagonists in all of American literature? No terribly much, as a matter of fact: each time I’ve read this book I wanted to kill myself. Holden’s always saying things like that, I mean, if you were to wear one blue sock and one red sock, and maybe slowly skin your shrivelfig under the comforting cotton of a green sock, he’d say something like, “God how I hate how that guy messes around with his socks, it makes me want to kill myself.” In that case, you’d better hope you’re at least in possession of a decent valise, lest that bastard Caulfield spread some  wrath upon you for your clearly inferior luggage. That guy, he really cracks me up.\tI never really understood why this book is so universally adored; sure, Holden is a slacker, the type of clown that every distraught kid envisions themselves to be, some gem in the rough with all the talent, but lacking the ambition to make a notable mark on the world which holds them back. But you grow up, if only to acknowledge you have no talents and still have no ambition, and instead of grabbing for that golden ring, you waste your time writing shitty reviews on shitty books here on goodreads on a ball-dampeningly warm Sunday afternoon. Come to think of it, that’s probably why so many appreciate this bumbling tale; like Holden, they probably equate themselves to that misshapen hunk of precious metal hidden beneath a untilled mound of Nebraskan soil, laying in wait for someone to unearth their sparkling brilliance for all the world to admire. Of course, when you realize Tucker Max probably felt the same way you immediately bathe in bromine and shave what remains of your flesh completely bald to scour the scourge as thoroughly as humanly possible. Perhaps it may be slightly  promising to delude yourself than resigning your life to the contemplation of just how lame you actually are.\tSo here’s a quick glimpse of what’s inspired so many lifelong laughingstocks. Here’s Holden fruitlessly swimming against the current, a complete nincompoop (let’s remember he’s Irish) who gets kicked out of school for being a moron and talks hard yet winds up getting the shit mercilessly beaten out of him by a crumby snob named Stradlater (a book about Studly Strad would have been far better) and a pimp named Maurice. Holden also feels the need to denounce everyone as a phony, though I find myself at a loss to imagine anything phonier than a wimpy, big-mouthed mick mollycoddled by daddy’s fat bankroll while attending prep school along with his stunning array of hand-crafted, Italian leather luggage. Let’s not gloss over the fact that Holden is probably impotent, as evidenced by his inability to lay the wood to Sally, Jane, or even a prostitute, perhaps his crowning disgrace. Either that or he’s queer, seeing as he duped poor Antolini by presenting his former mentor with the ultimate fantasy of a drunken, sexually-inexperienced youth with ‘no place to go’ and then, afraid that further action might expose his impotence, he felt the need to flee into the night, acting all startled about what just transpired. Let’s face it, Holden himself claims that similar ‘perverty’ stuff happened to him a lot as a kid, and then feigns shock when Antolini comes in to take a juicy bite of the bare bottom he so masterfully baited. All this weirdness coming from an awkward geek with a fondness for children ought to be enough to sway any who remain unconvinced thus far. You’re STILL not seeing the light?!? Seriously? Ok, last clue Caulfield is a deviant: the kid aspires to be a “catcher”. And this ‘catcher’ fantasy involves children. If you need further explanation I’ll be required to rent a jackhammer to pound the obvious into your skull.\tThis will hopefully be the last time that I read “The Catcher in the Rye”, as I’ve given it too many chances and always walked away completely disappointed. I will give Salinger's opus two stars, however, simply for the entertainment of laughing at it.",

If I wouldn't have known when the story was written, I would have guessed it only came out in the past couple of decades. So if the reason you haven't picked up this book is that you're afraid of having trouble with the obsolete words that are generally used in classics - don't worry, you'll be fine!There are many repetitive phrases, and I can totally understand why someone might find this annoying, but I personally really like things like that in books. I actually made it my mission to highlight every single line where the main character Holden mentions that \"something killed him\", he's feeling depressed/nervous/etc, something/someone is mad/a madman, something is (according to him) only \"sort of\" happening, something is relating to death in some way, and a couple of other little things...Boy, was I busy! There is something marked on every.single.page!So if you're someone that doesn't like repetition...yeah, it's save to say this book probably isn't for you.Now, while we're on the topic of Holden: I'm sure he is one of the most hated characters of all time, because I see and hear countless of people talking about how pretentious and irritating he is. I also understand those opinions, but I just absolutely fell in love with him!The reason for that is easy to find: I relate to him. I understand this anger and frustration at everything and everyone. I understand feeling like no matter what good happens to you, it just isn't enough and you still end up feeling lost and alone. If I had read this book a couple of years ago, I would have thought that Holden is pretty much a male version of me, and I would have thrown it in the faces of everybody who was helplessly trying to understand me. Thankfully, I have now moved passed this stage, and I can look at him and his (or  so: our previously shared) view of the world a bit  critically. But reading the book at the stage of my life were I am now, it also showed me that it's still far to easy for me to relate to and sympathize with characters like Holden. It made me realize that I've still got a long way to go. My ambition is to reread this book in ten years or so and only feel connected to Holden in a distant and long-passed way.Lastly, I'd like to mention that is a 100% character-driven book. There is only a very small amount of plot (and that small amount is rather generic). This is  of a character study, so if you're looking for a exciting tale filled with action and adventure - this is not the book for you.",

Salinger takes the reader on a ride through a few days of an adolescent’s life at the age of sixteen. Holden Caulfield has just been told that he’s flunked out of another preparatory school and must make the journey home to relay this to his parents. However, as this is not the first time, he is in no hurry to do so, and thus begins the meandering trip back to admit failure. In a narrative told from Caulfield’s perspective, the reader learns much about this boy as he wanders aimlessly around campus and eventually makes his way back to New York City. With a mixture of present-day happenings and tangential flashbacks, the reader sees Caulfield as a man who has seen much, but also knows very little. Salinger allows the slowly-developing narrative to continue, while Caulfield discovers just how much of the world is still unknown, all while he worries about how to tell his family the news that he is academically useless. By the time he reaches home, Caulfield has one last chance to shape his story, but even then, his younger sister steals the spotlight and recounts some of her own drama. Surely, this family loves being vapid and speaking in tangential styles that drown out any hope of understanding a topic at hand. Salinger must have a message here and literary critics found it, sipping from the proverbial Kool-Aid in droves. For me, it sets the bar quite low for what might be called classical literature. This may best be read with a glass of rye, for only then will you catch its meaning.I have long debated with people about what makes a novel “a classic”. Interestingly enough, no one can really tell me enough to sway my opinion. I am left to wonder if Salinger simply wrote at a time when it was ‘en vogue’ to be tangential and superficial, thus making this the cornerstone of something stellar. My father, who was an English teacher, would surely have some answers for me, though I am at a loss to think about how even he might help remove me from the paper bag in which I found myself. His passing years ago does little to help me now (and I am beginning to write tangentially, which is solely the fault of this book!). Holden Caulfield comes across as a typical teenage boy of the time (post-war), who is trying to make his mark on the world. He struggles with defining himself and those around him, wanting to fit in and yet differentiate himself significantly. While he accomplishes little on his meandering journey from school to the family home, Caulfield is able to show the reader that he has grit and determination, even if it comes across as less than important. Many of the others who cross paths with Caulfield serve as signposts in his narrative, wallflowers when he needs them to be and actively helping to formulate the story when necessary. I had little connection to any of them and found Salinger wanted it that way. The story was nothing worth noting and I am sure I will be scorned for missing many of the nuggets embedded into the tale. That said, when I hear classic, I expect much  than I got and while i cannot take away from J.D. Salinger, I am left to wonder if I was too sober and too grounded to accept this for what it should have been. It may not have been drivel, but the only classic aspect of it was that I was not forced to spend hours of my time for nothing.Kudos, Mr. Salinger, for being able to bask in the limelight. I missed the mark and I am sure others will educate me.

I had kept myself away from the The Chronicles of Narnia for a long time, believing I had already outgrown that phase of my life that would've endeared me to this famed set of fantasy tales written for children.

Lewis had opined - \"A children's story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children's story in the slightest\" - and who, indeed, would dare contradict him? I had kept myself away from the The Chronicles of Narnia for a long time, believing I had already outgrown that phase of my life that would've endeared me to this famed set of fantasy tales written for children. Eventually, when I did read The Magician's Nephew, I realized how hopelessly wrong I was. With The Catcher in the Rye, I'm faced with the same realization all over again.Some books are written so well, so masterfully that you are bound to get the message the writer had slipped in, skilfully, somewhere between its pages for the perceptive reader to find and cherish like treasure, only if you care to lay off the preordained feelings and biases.Sure, I agree, nothing ever happens in this book. The prose, in Holden's own overused words, can be described as 'boring' and insipid in my own. But that is what Salinger had wanted it to be.I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have liked Holden had I read this as a teen. I would've considered him a whiny, nitpicking pain in the rear. A kid trying to sound and behave like an adult and, of course, failing at it miserably. But now that I'm a full-fledged adult, capable of knowing what I want and what I don't, I can understand Holden much better. And I can't help but feel a sort of grudging respect for Holden's daring act of breaking away even if for a little while, from the compulsions and responsibilities that life threw his way, the expectations of peers and adults surrounding him.His voice is so full of recalcitrance, loneliness, resentment and all the amorphous emotions of that age, that it's near impossible not to relate to it. A sense of pure isolation, a feeling of being adrift in the big, bad world, sometimes with barely anything or anyone acting as an anchor. Faced with problems you previously did not even know existed, an ever-widening gap with the members of the opposite sex. A mass of confusing, blurry thoughts swirling inside your head that you would rather prefer to push away than disentangle one by one and analyze. Sometimes not being sure of what you want to do and what you are supposed to do. Stuck somewhere in a time-warp, on the brink of adulthood yet not quite so. Demanding to be treated with respect and dignity like an adult, yet to be loved as a child. I'm sure we have all gone through the same motions at some point of time in our lives.Holden reminds us of that period even if we may not see in him the teenager each one of us had been, individually. He is simply a personification of those confusing, bitter, hazy years that precede the surer, firmer,  secure years.And if we maybe honest enough with ourselves we'll find a Holden, all holed up somewhere in the darkest recesses of our psyche, eternally disdainful and critical of the people and things around him. It's just that we've gotten better at keeping 'him' hidden and swallowing urges to lash out at the 'phoniness' of it all. Holden's appeal is timeless. And I'm quite sure, I'll like this book when I read it again, years down the line. And for this reason alone, The Catcher in the Rye rightly deserves a place in the halls of classic American literature.This is THE YA novel. And, perhaps, will always be. P.S:- My love for this book is not to be interpreted as an endorsement of teenage delinquency or rebellious/anti-social behavior. ",

This book is a work of genius.The book is a \"coming of age\" tale, but it certainly transcends the adolescent garbage that fills up most of the genre. The protagonist is 16 year old Holden Caulfield - depressed, aimless, and disillusioned. The entire story covers just one December weekend in which he seeks to find direction in his life after flunking out of another prep school. As Caulfield contemplates his transition from adolescence to adulthood, he becomes disgusted with the utter \"phoniness\" of society and longs for the innocence of youth.Where Salinger's masterpieces surpasses other notable coming of age novels such as \"Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man\" and \"This Side of Paradise\" is in the treatment of social s. Where these other novels offer a one-dimensional treatment of sexuality and religious apostasy as the sum-all of maturation, Salinger offers a  complicated,  realistic picture. Caulfield's narrative certainly deals with sexuality, but he goes beyond the stock material of young man bucking sexual conventions. After first boasting about past sexual encounters, Caulfield admits he's actually a virgin. At an age in which sexual experience is a badge of honor for most young men, Caulfied decides that sex should be as much spiritual as physical and ought to be shared only with someone he really cares about. When his sexually experienced roommate goes out with an innocent childhood friend, Caulfield throws it down with the young man in protest against the perceived assault on innocence. Later, Caulfield accepts a prostitute into his room only to become depressed, pay the girl, and turn her out without accepting her services. The following day, Caulfield donates $10 to two humble nuns, the same amount paid to the whore the night before.Salinger's treatment of religion is equally nuanced and equally honest. While claiming to be \"practically an atheist,\" Caulfield also admits that he has a desire to pray. While disclaiming a belief in God, he occasionally asks what Christ would think about people's actions. In Caulfield's conflict, the reader sees a certain disgust with the phoniness of organized religion set against a sincere acceptance of Christ's actual message.So while this book shares with other novels a contempt for societal s, it is not a simple repudiation of religion in favor of unrestrained sexuality. Caulfield does reject most of the adult world he encounters as utterly \"phony,\" but he does not follow the stock pattern laid down by earlier modernists. Caulfield questions it all, perhaps despising Hollywood above everything else.So what does Caulfield accept after rejecting all of adult society? Childhood innocence. The only thing that makes this young man happy is spending time with children, his young sister most of all. Indeed, the section giving rise to the title of the work is a poignant plea for saving innocent children from the phoniness and corruption of the world.So for all the past scandal about the profanity and sexuality in this work, there is much to be admired by the secularist and the Christian alike. That's difficult to do, but Salinger pulls it off marvelously. Though we can't all agree what influences in society are corrupting, I think most everyone can agree that there is initially some purity that is corrupted.",

And at the same moment you become unhappy that this book will end soon, for you have now a very special and strong bond with the narrator, you feel this connection, your heart feels the narrator's pain and enjoys when everything's going grand in his life. With heavy heart as you reach to the very last pages, you become afraid of the ending, your head says to finish what you started and heart says I don't know what to do. You feel like the book cheated you, it never warned you about the ending, you never gave it a thought when you read its very first lines, you didn't know that the character's, the author's ideas are going to stick to you for the next week; and for some... for their entire life.This is what this book did to me, I'd had heard a lot about this book and for someone who likes to read a lot, it becomes shameful if somebody finds out that they'd not read such classic books. Even when you find it out yourself, that what you've been doing all your life that you hadn't made time to read such books. So it was important for me to read it soon.There are things one should keep in mind that whenever you're going to read a book, its gonna change something in you in the end and you'd spent the rest of the day to figure out what change had it done. You'll probably think you've become a better person, you've gained some knowledge, you'll smile again and again, you'll feel struck to the moment, the world will look somehow changed, a better place, you'll feel the air you're breathing, for books that shocks the hell out of you, you'll be dumbfounded for some time, scared, you'd need to talk it out to someone, if you'd find a person, no matter what you'll vomit it out, everything, what you felt, how much it has affected you, you don't care if they criticize you and curse you of becoming spoiler, you just had to speak to someone who listens, listens carefully, you'll say it has changed you, it surely did, every good book does but you'll never, never be sure of what change it has brought in your life.So as I came to last chapter, I was mentally begging this author to not to tell me the ending, I was struck with the protagonist, Holden Caulfield and was scared to let him go. He speaks what you always think about almost everything, about how he cannot stand to phony people, about the ducks that he doesn't know where do they go when the lagoon is frozen, about his sister, classmates, students at school, teachers and his brother who is no . I got to know what it is like to write whatever I think. And when he says exactly what I said to my friends or Mom few days back, at that very moment I know I'm not alone, I never was, someone with same opinion about that topic exist somewhere.To me, it was an adventure to get know about a particular stage in someone's life.",

I know Holden is an arrogant and mainly unlikeable character, but that doesn't make the book arrogant or unlikeable. It's about exploring why Holden is this way, the hilarity that ensues because of this, and making up your own mind about what Salinger is trying to say. Interestingly it's very often mentioned that Salinger had one of the most exhaustive and traumatic experiences during WW2 but chose instead to write about innocence and youth. I think that's really relevant. You might be part of the group that doesn't like this book because it \"doesn't have a plot\" but I liked that because it just felt like normal life. Regardless, I say give it a go! It's been one of the things I've most enjoyed this year.",

In fact, as the novel opens, Holden has just gotten kicked out of yet another private prep school; it is right before holiday, in fact, with his family expecting him home in two days anyway, so he's decided to just hoof it around the New York area for the next 48 hours and spend some time thinking about his life.As a result, not much of note actually happens to Holden over the next two days -- he visits an old teacher he doesn't like very much, invites an ex-girlfriend he doesn't like very much to go traveling with him, eventually ends up in Manhattan, then back at his parents' place, and then finally an amusement park while entertaining his little sister. The main point of the book, then, is to try to understand Holden as a character and deeply flawed human; to watch the way he looks at life, to notice the way he idolizes his older brother, out in Hollywood and making a living as a screenwriter. Holden is both restless and old-fashioned, tender and cruel, someone who is sometimes blurting out uncomfortable truths and sometimes lying right to your face. And by the time we're done, hopefully we've learned something not only about him in particular but about teens in general, and especially the sense of alienation and standoffishness that comes to so many at that age no matter when in history we're talking about.The argument for it being a classic:The argument for this being a classic is a clean and simple one -- it is demonstrably the very first book in history to establish the \"confessional young adult\" genre, one that has grown in our modern times to accommodate tens of thousands of books and millions of grateful teen fans. Before Catcher in the Rye, its fans say, there were only two types of stories considered appropriate for younger readers -- either moralistic tales that very sternly taught right from wrong, or the kind of psuedo-science babble mysteries like I was mentioning last week, when I was reviewing 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. Salinger was the very first person to publish a book about a teen written from the teen's point of view himself, a very raw point of view that contains sex, filth, cursing galore, and all the other prurient stuff that comes with peeking inside a 16-year-old boy's head; it was a breakthrough of the Modernist era, fans claim, one of those seminal projects that broke the ground for all the naturalistic books and films in the '50s, '60s and '70s that came afterwards. Oh, and if this weren't enough, it just also happens to be the most censored book in the history of the United States, as well as a personal favorite of both Mark David Chapman (who killed John Lennon) and John Hinckley Jr (who shot Ronald Reagan); these facts alone almost guarantee it a spot on any list of classics.The argument against:The main argument against this being a classic seems to be that it's become a victim of its own success; indeed, Catcher in the Rye has been so influential over the decades, its critics say, an entire genre of \"Salingeresque\" work now exists (which like I said is  formally known as \"confessional young adult\"), many books of which are actually much better than the original that started them all. After all, let's admit it, Catcher in the Rye has its problems, ones typical of any young and inexperienced writer (which Salinger was when first penning this); just as one good example, there are only so many times you can use the word 'g-ddam' in one story before it becomes a self-parodying joke. Like many of the books being reviewed in this essay series, I don't think there's a single human out there who would deny this novel's historical importance; but that's not what we're trying to determine here with the CCLaP 100, but rather whether it's a book you personally should read before you die.My verdict:So imagine my shock when I found myself finishing this book and saying to myself, \"My God -- JD Salinger is basically Judy Blume with  cursing.\" (Or to be completely fair, I guess that should be worded -- \"My God, Judy Blume is basically JD Salinger with Jews and menstruation.\") I guess I had been expecting a lot , given what a supernaturally high regard this book has among such a large swath of the general population; I was expecting it to not only be a good Young Adult novel (which it admittedly is) but also something that was going to reveal some sort of transcendent truth about the world to me as a fully-grown adult.Er...it doesn't. This is just a good Young Adult novel, and you owe it to yourself to know that going into it; that unless you're a teen yourself when you read it, there really isn't going to be anything too terribly original or groundbreaking found in this manuscript. In fact, you could argue that Salinger was quite smart to basically wall himself off from the press and general public after this book, and never publish again (he's still alive, by the way, for those who don't know, reputedly living a happy and quiet life somewhere on the Atlantic Seaboard); because ultimately this is not a great book but simply a good one, eventually made legendary because of the time period it was published, and the subsequent reclusive career that Salinger has had. Its overwhelming historical significance I think earns it a place on the classics list, plus the fact that it's not actually a bad book at all; it's just that this is a kind of book that adults have already read many times before, especially if you were a fan of such authors as Betsy Byars when you were a teen yourself. Is it a classic? I suppose ",

The whole time I read this book I couldn't help but focus on his mental breakdown. He was a walking poster child for emotional disease. Although Salinger 's style of writing is a bit choppy and repetitive, he does an excellent job of expressing adolescent angst. His tangential pattern reflects Holden's thought process, which, when a person is depressed, can never stay on task or complete a notion. So many in this age group feel this way even today maybe even  so ; they just have  activities they're forced to participate in to hide the sadness and feed the anxiety. As for my three star rating it simply reflects my desire to never read this again. It was good; I'm glad I read it. I'm ready to move on. ",

Anyone who goes through phases of detachment will relate to this book easily. Anyone who generally finds themselves content with the world we live in will not discern any value in this novel without being open-minded to the opinions of people who see the world from a less admirable point of view. I think that is the best explanation I can offer as to why some people really feel for this book and others don't.Sixteen year old Holden Caulfield has just been expelled from school for the umpteenth time. After leaving the school premises he travels straight to a nearby hostel where he plans to stay for a few days so that he is not at home when his parents receive the news of his expulsion. Living alone in the city for a couple of days leaves Holden to seek weird encounters with strangers and old friends. As well as wandering aimlessly around the city for days, Holden is contemplating the people who have left a mark on him so far in his life, while also pondering his loathing for superficial and pretentious things that people do for popularity and success. The young man is at a point where he is questioning the purpose and sincerity of everything to the extent where it is wearing his interest to participate in life. I think why 'The Catcher in the Rye' has been so successful over the past several decades is because of its interesting depiction of issues that only concern us as we get older. Although I wasn't alive in the 1950s, I feel like this book was ahead of its time, as it swerved from traditional themes and methods of storytelling, giving it a modernist air and therefore contributing to its success for being alternative. As for the controversy, that may be due to its underlying message that cynicism holds  truth than optimism.",

This teenage chap named Holden will sit with you for a while, smoke a cigarette and drink a shot, and talk about how the society is so much into fame and money, and how everyone just forget the values of life, and share with you the desire to run away. And then you hear his little stories about his younger brother Allie's baseball glove, and his smart and thoughtful sister Phoebe, and his dream to be a catcher in the rye to save children from falling down the cliff.

Và bạn biết rằng đằng sau cái vẻ ngoài chửi tục thành thần, nốc rượu rít thuốc như điên và cách cư xử bốc đồng của hắn, là một trái tim nhạy cảm và một cái đầu thông minh, một kẻ đã nhận ra chân giá trị của cuộc sống.

He makes a funny little reference against the Charles Dickens monstrocity in the first few sentences. That almost gets Salinger one  star from me on principal. However, I can't say that the interest stuck. This book is the epitome of depression-filled, angsty gobbledygook that high schools shove down teenagers throats in an effort to make them think deep thoughts - or to attempt to relate to them somehow. It's true that there were many times that I felt depressed and alienated in high school. Somehow reading about it in literature did nothing for any sort of need for me. Maybe it does for some people, but I think it was bad enough dealing with it in reality than reading some dismal thing and exploring its dark depths of depravity.I really don't know why they advertise such emotionally unstable stuff to a group of people with raging hormones anyway. I'm not saying to ban it. People should be able to read what they want. I just don't think it should be required reading. It seems to be fuel for  depression.I mean this in sardonic facetiousness: it's not the swearing dialogue, or the character's behavior that makes it so inappropriate. It's the fact that one might want to slash their wrists after this read. We always talked about how we're supposed to talk about and reflect how literature affects us in school. Then we wonder why a huge percentage of people are pumped up on prozac and other happy pills. :P",

Holden rejects his privileged background (though not for any great philosophical reason, however much he might try to dress it up as such) and runs away from his prep school when he is expelled. He drifts through the seedy side of life for a couple of days before feeling pulled homeward to his sister and then a teacher. He doesn’t fit in either world.The specific events are less important than the insight into Holden’s troubled adolescent mind, though it’s clear his memory is selective at best and probably partly fabricated.

Cz i was crying becuase of the greatness of what i read.There will be some SPOILERS so stop reading here if you mind SPOILERS. I am sorry. I've read many reviews of all you guys and how can you possibly not see what Salinger did? It is  than what is seems to be, it's so much . You all say how Holden is an arrogant and how he doesn't care and how much of an unlikable character he is. Do you know what i see? I see a kid in pain. He is in so much pain, he is hurt. Deeply. You don't randomly want to cry unless you are constantly suffering. And he is suffering and he is in denial about everything and everyone. He is kind of in love with a childhood friend and he cannot get over the loss of a family member. He feels lonely. No matter how many people are around him or with him, he feels lonely and alone and nobody can fulfill him. He needs to be needed and that is heavily pointed in the book. How can you not see that? He is depressed and he showed sings of panic attacks several times in the book. He is impulsive and a mess, but he is not a bad person. I stand by what i wrote here. He has a kind soul. All he ever needed was a hug and someone to hold his hand. He needed someone to love him and be there. He needed affection. While reading this i understood that Holden had a chance, he did the right thing when nobody was watching. But he behaved like a child cz he didn't want to show his weekness and pain to the world and most importantly, to himself. He wouldn't admit any of these, so he was trying, to cope in a way, with his everything by trying to avoid everything. He became numb and he became bitter. But feelings come up sometime, you cannot hide from them and you cannot avoid them. And i saw him with his little sister and i thought, \"that's a person whom he loves, and this person loves him back.\" And the time that he was starting to lose the fight, that time, his little sister triggered him. She saved him. And i saw it coming and he was happy at that moment and i was crying at that moment. His little sister saved him, unintentionaly cz she was too young to understand how and why, but she saved him.It kinda feels weird because the way i perceived this book was so different from what i read in the reviews after finishing it and mayby it's bcz i dived in knowing nothing. I cannot help it, i love this kid, i really do. P.S. Holden, man, i think we could be great friends.",

I didn't know what it was about; I just knew that it was one of those modern classics that everyone should read. I never knew that it would become my book. The character of Holden Caulfield is one of the most polarising characters out there; you either love or hate him. I was firmly on the side of love. Holden's words spoke to me, to the lonely kid dealing with a serious illness. He got it. He knew what it felt like to be lost and confused, to be sad, to feel like every situation was life or death... He just got me. And this book became a part of my soul. \"Among other things, you'll find that you're not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior. You're by no means alone on that score, you'll be excited and stimulated to know. Many, many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now. Happily, some of them kept records of their troubles. You'll learn from them - if you want to. Just as someday, if you have something to offer, someone will learn something from you. It's a beautiful reciprocal arrangement. And it isn't education. It's history. It's poetry.\"Now a lot of time has passed. I'm older and hopefully wiser. Would Holden still speak to me? How would I feel about him now as an adult? Looking at him from the other side?I wanted to read this book so badly but I was scared. Scared of falling out of love with the one boy who understood my teenage soul. However, a few days ago my wonderful friend and current GR absentee Rohisa made a beautiful post on Instagram about writing in books. About weaving your life into the book for the next person after you to connect with. And she struck a chord within me. Some people may be appalled at this notion; how could I desecrate a book in such a way? I like to believe that books have a memory. They not only tell the story within their pages, they also tell the story of those who have held the book; the stories of whose eyes have peered within their soul and whose hearts have been stolen by their words. So to me, the concept of writing in a book is about leaving my mark and a part of my soul within these pages. The cracked and broken spine tells of a book much beloved rather than the unflawed and unread shiny new paperback. The lovingly creased and folded pages with highlighted passages tells of a personal connection to the novel. What words moved the reader the most.So what better book to mark with my thoughts and feelings in the margins than my old favourite, The Catcher in the Rye. The journey would not just be Holden's story, but mine too. And how did it go???Better than I could ever have imagined. Sometimes there are no words to describe how a book makes you feel but I will try...When I finished the story I had tears in my eyes. I still loved Holden. I love him. I still understand Holden but it is now from a different angle. He still feels like me but I have seen so much  of life since I first read this book that now I feel I understand better than he does... But he will always be the first one who understood me. \"Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around - nobody big, I mean - except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff - I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.

I’m sure there were plenty of themes and hidden meanings that were just going SWOOSH over my head, however the unignorable themes of teenage angst and rebellion are present from the very first page.Holden himself is... complex. I felt quite sorry for him at points throughout the book, yet every time he said that something “killed him” how I wish I COULD kill him!! Repetitive phrases quickly become very irritating for me and that occurs in abundance in this book.The plot itself is also very meandering... if I had to describe what happened, I would struggle. It actually reminded me a lot of American Psycho. The crazy narrative from our protagonist, repetitive sequences... but I absolutely LOVED American Psycho and found Patrick Bateman to be highly entertaining!Holden clearly suffers from some mental health problems, I’m not a psychiatrist so I can’t diagnose, but there seems to be signs of depression as well as ADHD - potentially other issues too? And I can only feel sympathetic when a character demonstrates such struggles with their mental health. A particular scene towards the end - involving his sister - did make me feel very sad.But at the same time, it was a slog to get through certain sections. So I feel very conflicted overall. I’m glad I read it though, I’m just not sure I’d ever pick it up again unfortunately! However the longer I sit and think about it... the  I find myself almost liking the book? I DON’T KNOW.

I’m not kidding. I expected not to like this book and all, because I’d heard so many phonies go on and on about it. It made me feel like jumping through a window on the 81st floor, if you want to know the truth. But it killed me. It really did. Well, that’s enough of that. Really, after putting down The Catcher in the Rye, I can’t help but think there has been some sort of terrible misunderstanding. The level of discussion surrounding this book (apart from conspiracy theories) too often amounts to a petty popularity contest for Holden Caulfield, where people argue about whether he was or wasn’t a swell guy. But here’s what we’re missing. When a character is so lifelike, so round, and so memorable that the question of your liking him is so pressing, the author has already succeeded. Salinger has performed that minor miracle that so often passes under our noses, unnoticed. A miracle that only the greatest fiction writers are able to accomplish: creating a fully fledged human being from pen, ink, and paper.  Like him or not, Holden sticks with you. He has a definite personality, a unique perspective. Are we to be so narrow-minded that we will put down a book just because we wouldn’t want to be friends with the main character? I hope not. In fact, you know who judges books by that very standard? Holden Caulfield:What really knocks me out is a book that, when you’re all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it.I think it's great that this has become one of the book's most popular quotes. The irony is delicious. So, if you don’t like The Catcher in the Rye because you don’t like Holden, you should take a good hard look at yourself. But on the other hand, if you think Holden totally ‘gets’ you, that you aspire to his intellectual depth and philosophy of life, stay the hell away from me. I mean it. Both sides completely miss the point of this book. Holden is a deeply flawed person, whose search for authenticity makes him  of a phony than any of the people he criticizes. Although he constantly voices his strong opinions about the world, he is incurably ignorant. More than that, he is completely unable to please himself. He misses the people who piss him off, and when he calls up the people he misses, they piss him off. It’s an endless cycle. All of his criticisms of the outside world are bitter and thoughtless, and all of his criticisms of himself are superficial. And, boy, is this book American. This book is  American than getting drone-striked with a giant, flaming apple pie. It almost felt like I was bleeding red, white, and blue blood from my eyeballs.By way of illustration, allow me go through some American literature, just so you can hear the echoes of our accent through the ages. I’ll start with the great leviathan at the beginning, Moby Dick:Call me Ismael. Some years ago—never mind how long—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.And now for Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby:In my younger and  vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my head ever since.\"Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,\" he told me, \"just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.\"Hemmingway’s The Sun Also Rises:Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton. Do not think that I am very much impressed by that as a boxing title, but it meant a lot to Cohn.Mark Twain’s Huckleberry Finn:You don’t know about me without you have read a book by the name of “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,” but that ain’t no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he strectched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing.And finally Salinger’s book:If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you’ll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don’t feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.First of all, I find it interesting that so many of our classic books are first-person narratives. But let us explore the themes. I think that The Catcher in the Rye is the direct descendent of Huckleberry Finn. Huck and Holden are about the same age. Both are disaffected youths that go on an adventure. Both are, like Ismael, orphans, adrift on a piece of rubbish. But in terms of personality, the two couldn’t be  different. Though Huck is poor and lowly, he is constitutionally jolly, incapable of being depressed or angry. Holden, of course, is the reverse, even though Holden is from a wealthy family. Huck does not judge. Even when he sees the most transparent, despicable swindlers, he does not condemn. Holden will damn you to hell just for clipping your nails. That’s where the second ingredient comes in, Hemmingway’s Jake Barnes. Although the two books are in many ways different, The Catcher in the Rye and The Sun also Rises explore almost identical thematic territory: disaffection, identity crisis, self-conciousness, alienation, impotence, hopelessness. Jake Barnes got his bits blown off in the war; Holden invites a prostitute to his room and chickens out. Both characters drift from person to person, getting sick of one, and then substituting another, just to repeat the process. Both idealize the pure and genuine. For Barnes (and Hemmingway) it was nature; for Holden it was childhood. But the impulse is the same—something opposed to the bullshit of normal life. So, there you have it. Marry the naiveté of Huck Finn with the despair of Jake Burnes, and you get Holden Caulfield—the adolescent in all of us. The juvenile impulse that allows us to take ourselves seriously enough to identify with war veterans in Hemmingway’s novels when we're little boys. The melodramatic sense that we are the protagonists in the world’s story, and everyone else is just an extra. The unshakable conviction that, deep down, we know what’s wrong with the world, and are above it. I hope we grow out of it. That’s why I don’t think this book should be assigned to high school students. At Holden’s age, you can’t understand it. You’re in it. If you like or dislike Holden, it’s for all the wrong reasons, and you end up with the palaver that currently surrounds this book. My opinion? It’s a marvelous novel, and Salinger is a master of the craft. It is a piece of art, not a religious text. So treat it like one. Read, and enjoy. And perhaps even reflect. But maybe the best thing we can do is to internalize the advice in the beginning of The Great Gatsby, and hold off on our judgments—either of Holden or anyone else. Or else you might end up as miserable as he is.",

What if J.D. Salinger isn't as amazing of a writer as I once remembered? When he died, I knew it was time to justify that position on my favorite books shelf.It took me a week and half to read this book because I wanted to savor it. What a powerful story teller (if only he'd learn how to break a few paragraphs every once in awhile). Love or hate Holden, you get Holden. That moment when he held the snowball and looked out over the snowy street below, unable to throw the snowball because it looked too pretty, was such a fabulous example of showing us Holden's personality and his insecurities about himself in the world, that it made me smile. So much of his quirky personality, word choice, exaggerations and the way J.D. Salinger writes it with such power and metaphor made me smile (well minus the use of about the only swear words that makes me cringe).I have a weakness for good boy protagonists. Girls get whiny and annoying, but boys bottle it up so you want to protect them. I found the scene where Holden fights with his roommate for saying he messed around with a girl he liked so powerful. You can feel the emotion breathing off Holden and know exactly what he's thinking despite what he says. For all his angst, Salinger gives us enough of his emotional breakdowns and his show of good heart that you feel for him, even if you want to shake him. Dealing with his brother's death and his insecurities about living up to his family, he's falling apart, but even those who see that he needs don't get that his alienation and apathy are self preservation. I can't help but think that he wanted to protect kids so much because he needed someone protecting him. He's such a child, his whole character full of irony. He needs his own catcher in the rye, standing on the edge of that cliff to make sure he doesn't fall.",

He just can't seem to fit in anywhere. Pretty much everyone he meets annoys him for one reason or another. He's basically just unhappy with the entire world, saying it's full of phonies.Holden rambles when he talks and can't stay on the same subject for very long. He gets sidetracked and distracted easily, and is failing most of his classes. I just kept thinking to myself, this kid is manic depressive. All the signs are there that he's suffering from bipolar disorder and suicidal tendencies. I just kept thinking, we need to get this guy to a hospital. His character is extremely similar to the character 'Pat' (played by Bradley Cooper) in 'Silver Linings Playbook.'It's a sad book, truthfully, with some funny lines for comic relief. Holden is a huge exaggerator, and he made me laugh out loud several times with sentences like, “His name was Commander 'Blop' or something. He was one of those guys that think they're being a pansy if they don't break around FORTY of your fingers when they shake hands with you.”With Holden, everything that ever happened to him was 'a hundred and fifty years ago' or 'a million times worse.' His exaggerations were hilarious, but at the same time, his manic speech and behavior made me feel anxious and sad. Still, I'm so thankful I finally got around to reading this classic.",

I usually detest characters who complain on every other page, but Holden complained on pretty much every page and I still empathized with him. He's a lonely guy with an idealistic, unrealistic perspective who doesn't know how to hold his own in a world where not everything can be watered down to black and white and right and wrong. He's caring, emotional, and intelligent, but so thoroughly disconnected from everyone that he cannot express what he wants, if he even knows what that is. He is hurt, he needs to heal, and he is one of the few fictional characters who I would give a hug to if I could.Overall, major respect points to J.D. Salinger for writing what is commonly called the first real \"young-adult\" book/classic, and for creating the most banned book ever. The Catcher in the Rye should be read by anyone searching for a wonderfully misanthropic, tragically classic coming-of-age story.*interestingly enough, Carol Gilligan, a researcher in the field of developmental psychology, states that boys have a  absolute view of right and wrong while girls are  likely to take into account situational factors. Perhaps this plays a part in me and Holden's thinking pattern...*cross-posted from my blog, the quiet voice.",

And so...__________________________________________I can see why this book excites such strong reactions in people, although I think I might have gotten  out of it if I had finished it when I first started it  than half a lifetime ago.The voice of this one is very interesting – although, we are much  familiar with it today than people probably were when this book first appeared. This is Woody Allen as a boy. I guess I have to use the phrase, ‘teenage angst’ at least once. It is hard to know what to make of this book – it is hard to know if one is to identify with the main character or not – and after hearing his story told in first person and having lived through lots of emotionally charged experiences with him, it is hard to stand too aloof. All the same, this isn’t someone I could entirely identify with, but then, I don’t think this is a book that was written to get someone my age to identify with the main character. This is a teenage angst book written to be appreciated most by those going through teenage angst. I don’t want this review to sound too negative – I actually enjoyed the book quite a lot – however, many of the themes have become so standard and have been repeated almost as much as that Dirty Harry moment when the good guy has to run from phone box to phone box before dropping off the money. If you haven’t read this one, you actually know the story very well, you just don’t know it yet.Which I also found interesting – as I wasn’t totally sure what this book would be about before I started reading it. I did make a half-hearted start to it a life time ago in High School, but stopped very early on and never quite got back to it. I think I would have enjoyed this book  then than I did now.The character I found most interesting was good old Phoebe. It is interesting that he nearly constantly refers to her as old Phoebe when really she is much younger than him. She is his baby sister. But if this book is anything it is a hall of mirrors. One of the main distortions in the reality of what we might expect in this book was Phoebe. Holden’s first conversation with her is a real ‘out of the mouths of babes’ moment. We have just learnt that she has an extensive part in the school play and she (in a signalling piece of irony) is playing Benedict Arnold. Virtually her first act in the story is to selflessly protect her bother and put herself in danger of being punished for his sake. Also interesting is the fact that she tells Holden that he is constantly negative and completely without direction. It might be that she is just repeating what her parents have told her, all the same she comes across as one of ‘those’ children that one finds so often in novels; children who are far too old for their years.Holden’s dream of becoming the catcher in the rye, someone who essentially saves young children from accidental death caused by thoughtlessness, is also part of the mirror like distortions. Here is a young man on the cliff edge and his dream job is to catch and protect other young people in danger.This book was probably saved by being written in first person and by being seminal to the whole genre of stories about teenagers who don’t quite fit in, you know, all the way up to Donnie Darko. I think I enjoyed this book  than this review is really showing, but I think the book has probably dated and so it is much less shocking than I guess it would have been in 1950. All the same, how this book ends still does seem shocking to me. This is not a book about presenting solutions, and the solution that is being implemented at the end does not seem to be any sort of real solution. That this book could have become a classic confirms that it is not just a couple of us who felt alienated from the Real World while growing up. Perhaps the first sign of growing up is the day we realise that (in the immortal words of the Boomtown Rats) we should “Watch out for the normal people – there’s  of us than there’s of you!”Fortunately, Holden gets to be ‘treated’ at the end of this book and so everything is going to be just dandy – although, the kind of ennui he is suffering from is probably best cured by years than medication. This is the sort of teenage novel we are all too familiar with – a young man on the brink of adulthood suddenly released from the constraints of adult rules and thereby being able to ‘play’ at being an adult. Normally, in these teenage stories (even in the best of them, like The Graduate) we get to laugh – in this one reality is never far enough away for us to get a good belly laugh. This is not ‘the great teenage adventure’ – this is a book about dancing on the edge of the cliff and despite how much we might wish, there simply is no catcher in the rye waiting to save us.",

The story starts with him being unhappy and upset about everything and everyone around him. After being expelled from school, he decides not to go home and instead wanders around New York City all alone. During his time alone he experiences many mood shifts. He wants to fill his time doing something but he can’t do anything successfully. His depression, extreme happiness, arrogance, immaturity and restlessness makes it very hard for him to focus on one particular task. Troubled by the world, he faces severe alcoholism, deals with constant cigarette smoking and numerous mental breakdowns. This is a story about struggling to find one's place in the world, a lost teenager who probably does not want to be saved. The story is written in the first person which must have been challenging, but it is done in a way that the reader is captivated.However, considering the controversial topics, this book is not suitable for young kids. I agree that this book can be a ray of hope for some, who believe it is the end of the world after difficult situations but this book also comprises concepts that are misleading for the younger audience. I think this book expands your horizons on how and what a typical troubled teenager thinks. A small journey to the mind of one messed up but interesting character makes the readers realise that wandering alone is one essential part of growing up. ",

But I have no patience to imitate this book, considering that reading all of that was about as fun as having a root canal with no anesthetic. (Actually, that comparison is pretty funny, because I actually WAS at the dentist to have a root canal done the last time I read Salinger, and I had no qualms then about putting it down in favor of having my face drilled on. True story.)It's pretty amusing to me that my reading J.D. Salinger actually constitutes an endorsement for dental surgery. \"Thinking about reading Salinger? Save yourself some pain and irritation, and have a root canal instead! Anesthesia optional!\" So, yeah. There's not really much left for me to say about this. I pretty much hated every minute of reading it. I got nothing out of it. I didn't identify with Holden in any way, and I doubt that I was even jaded enough as a teen to have liked it then.

It is easy to just read it at face value, as a straightforward “bildungsroman” story and just get off the ride at the end of it with a sigh of satisfaction (or alternatively frisbee it into the bin). I am always happy to do that when reading for pleasure. Still, at certain points in the book things insist on jumping out at me. Holden Caulfield’s thought processes are interesting. Here is a teenager who resents everything and everybody, including himself. Sound familiar? He is clearly an unreliable narrator but he can also be very perceptive and insightful, not to mention goddam hilarious. For example:“Every time you mention some guy that's strictly a bastard--very mean, or very conceited and all--and when you mention it to the girl, she'll tell you he has an inferiority complex.”Now I don’t necessarily agree that this is true “every time” but it seems true enough to make me laugh. Certainly the novel starts off being just a funny witty silly irreverent story. Gradually the humor becomes darker and there is a tonal shift into melancholia. The narrative never entirely shed its sense of humor though, but there is usually a bitter undertone to all the sarcasms.If you don’t enjoy character centric fiction this book is probably not for you. It is all about characters. Not just Holden Caulfield himself but his sister Phoebe who is amazingly well developed given her brief appearances in the story. Then there is the kindly teacher Mr. Antolini, whose observation about how an academic education will “give you an idea what size mind you have” will always stay with me.Salinger’s flippant colloquial narrative style (via Holden Caulfield) is a pleasure to read and comes across as quite heartfelt and sincere. It is very tempting to start aping this style and write a crumby phony review, but it would kill me I swear it would, so I won’t.

I know it’ crazy.”Holden Caulfield.Holden Caulfield.Holden Caulfield.If you had been in the YA scene for too long, you'd have known him very well long before you actually got to know him. Of course, I was curious to see for myself what made him so celebrated a character, revered by teenagers world over. Naturally, TCITR was what came to my mind, at the thought of 'next book'. And, of course, I was flummoxed by the simplicity of the language used in the book. I kept looking at the title page to assure myself that I am holding the original book and not some bogus spinoff. I also found myself wishing  than once that it should be a spinoff- surely The Catcher in The Rye couldn't be that ridiculously juvenile. Reading the book was as tedious as reading a diary containing a miserable kid's incoherent scribblings. True to its notoriety, this book has received its share of sideswipes. I could understand what many people are trying to get at, but this book connected with me on many levels. ✅Straightforward language.My knowledge of English literature is limited to a paltry sum of one hundred books. For someone who had no proper knowledge of English until late teens, I had always imagined that all novels from around 1900s were as grandiloquent as The Fountainhead or Lolita(both of which I had the pleasure of reading recently). That's why Salinger's opus came as a pleasant blow- any book that doesn't have me rereading the same passage, willing it to make some sense, and doubling my reading time as a result, deserves plaudits. This book changed my perception of the writers based in the '40s' and '50s' entirely, and that's for good. ✅Antsy-teen exemplar Holden Caulfield.On the surface, TCITR feels like an enormous waste of time as Holden yammers about how he doesn't like anything that anyone does. The deep-rooted antagonism that Holden has for the world in general sets an ideal for a plethora of YA protagonists of today. Holden's tendency to brush off everything as fake establishes a dangerous trend for absolving oneself from his unwillingness to take responsibility for his own prevarication. We come across kids like Holden- \"kids on the loose\", I would like to call them- everyday. They are  precarious than a bandit brandishing a gun at us. Trying to knock some sense into their unyielding brains is like trying to save a drowning kid who is hell-bent on drowning. If you don't steer clear of these brats, you will end up drowning too. They are as fickle as wild animals, you have to tread cautiously around them. Or, you would meet the same fate as John Lennon(if you don't know the story already, you should Google it).But, maybe not everything is wrong with Holden's world as we are compelled into believing. He perceives the world as it is, better than we do.You take somebody that cries their goddam eyes out over phony stuff in the movies, and nine times out of ten they’re mean bastards at heart. I’m not kidding.If you are one of the persons that fails to earn Brownie points from Holden or get in his good books, then, maybe something is wrong with your world. That boy doesn't know a thing or two about living, but he certainly knows how to live it right.♛ Verdict:Old Holden Caulfield doesn't talk in codes and all. He means goddamn what he means. He gets a bang out of calling everybody a phony slob. Everybody who is a phony slob, that is. If you got goddamn dough and all, don't flaunt it. It kills him, my ass. I am a madwoman for not detesting this batshit-crazy boy. I swear to God I am. ",

If I didn't make it obvious already, I did not like the book that much, or, to be  exact, I did not like Holden. His whiny voice almost brought me to tears of pain a couple of times. His constant repetition, whining, stating that he was depressed, stating that something 'kills him', etc. I get why repetition is used in books, but here it was just plain irritating (at least to me it was). The only reason why I gave this book 2 stars, instead of 1, was because I liked some parts of it, and I liked a couple of 'supporting' characters. And that's all. I really disliked the rest. I can sort of see why people would like this book, but the question that troubles me, is how can people actually like Holden? Is it maybe because of the meaning? I haven't got a clue. To conclude, me and this book definitely didn't get along well, and I surely hope that I will never have to read it again (for university, or something), because I really don't want to go through the torture of reading The Catcher in the Rye ever again.",

I can see how it could be unlikeable. Holden is an annoying narrator. He vascilates from one opinion to the opposite in the span of a page, he rambles on often, he's got a low tolerance threshhold, and there are times he's just an ass. But, er, that's the point. If you don't like Holden, Salinger did his job.On the same token, I find it hard to hate Holden, because I see bits of me in him. Less now than when I look back on when I was his age, but I think most teens should be able to relate to Holden, especially male teens. If you can't, you're either incredibly well adjusted, and if that's the case, you lucked out, or you're the sort of person that drives someone to become Holden, jaded by everything before graduating High School, convinced everyone is phony... not that Holden himself isn't phony at times, but every teen is. The book isn't about events. The events are commonplace. They're supposed to be. It's about the character, and what he says, and to extrapolate, what it means. You could say it's cautionary, that Salinger is laughing at the spoiled rich brat he's writing Holden as, and that we the reader should take it as warning not to become him. We could see it as dystopian, that Salinger was commenting on the shallowness of American culture through the eyes of a child, one well-off enough to both see its most glaring pettiness as well as partake in it's seedier aspects. You could even see it as a bit of a commentary about what really matters... about how even the most cynical teen out there still has something they love (in Holden's case, family). You could even take that a step further, and see it psychologically... what damage a loss like that of Allie could cause in a young mind, etc. There's a lot to look into in The Catcher in the Rye... even the admittedly weak explaination of the title could spark discussion as to what it says about or means in terms of his character. These are just the impressions I get from it... hardly researched, but then, the best book discussions shouldn't come from research but from your heart. I just think that with many classics, people start looking for something huge... a big, rollicking plot, some amazing humour or poetic language, and sometimes the brilliance of a book is so much  subtle. Not that Holden can't turn a phrase, and certainly not to say that there are times when Holden's sheer contradictory nature jumps the line into humorous, and not even to say there aren't some big and poignant moments in the mundanity (word?) of the plot... simply that in a book like this, even those moneymaker bits are understated.

All with the mood swings, urges, shooting hormones and yes, of course, that unique quality teens have that makes the rest of the world just want to punch them in the eye.Holden, however, showed some endearing traits that sometimes escaped in-between all the arrogance. That, to me, served to prove that adolescence fades. Those traits felt like little bits of maturity already starting to sprout.Even if you can’t relate to Holden specifically, this novel is nostalgic. I get why this is a classic.",

He just can't seem to fit in anywhere. Pretty much everyone he meets annoys him for one reason or another. He's basically just unhappy with the entire world, saying it's full of phonies.Holden rambles when he talks and can't stay on the same subject for very long. He gets sidetracked and distracted easily, and is failing most of his classes. I just kept thinking to myself, this kid is manic depressive. All the signs are there that he's suffering from bipolar disorder and suicidal tendencies. I just kept thinking, we need to get this guy to a hospital. His character is extremely similar to the character 'Pat' (played by Bradley Cooper) in 'Silver Linings Playbook.'It's a sad book, truthfully, with some funny lines for comic relief. Holden is a huge exaggerator, and he made me laugh out loud several times with sentences like, “His name was Commander 'Blop' or something. He was one of those guys that think they're being a pansy if they don't break around FORTY of your fingers when they shake hands with you.”With Holden, everything that ever happened to him was 'a hundred and fifty years ago' or 'a million times worse.' His exaggerations were hilarious, but at the same time, his manic speech and behavior made me feel anxious and sad. Still, I'm so thankful I finally got around to reading this classic.",

He is hurt, he needs to heal, and he is one of the few fictional characters who I would give a hug to if I could.Overall, major respect points to J.D. Salinger for writing what is commonly called the first real \"young-adult\" book/classic, and for creating the most banned book ever. The Catcher in the Rye should be read by anyone searching for a wonderfully misanthropic, tragically classic coming-of-age story.*interestingly enough, Carol Gilligan, a researcher in the field of developmental psychology, states that boys have a  absolute view of right and wrong while girls are  likely to take into account situational factors.

And so...__________________________________________I can see why this book excites such strong reactions in people, although I think I might have gotten  out of it if I had finished it when I first started it  than half a lifetime ago.The voice of this one is very interesting – although, we are much  familiar with it today than people probably were when this book first appeared. This is Woody Allen as a boy. I guess I have to use the phrase, ‘teenage angst’ at least once. It is hard to know what to make of this book – it is hard to know if one is to identify with the main character or not – and after hearing his story told in first person and having lived through lots of emotionally charged experiences with him, it is hard to stand too aloof. All the same, this isn’t someone I could entirely identify with, but then, I don’t think this is a book that was written to get someone my age to identify with the main character. This is a teenage angst book written to be appreciated most by those going through teenage angst. I don’t want this review to sound too negative – I actually enjoyed the book quite a lot – however, many of the themes have become so standard and have been repeated almost as much as that Dirty Harry moment when the good guy has to run from phone box to phone box before dropping off the money. If you haven’t read this one, you actually know the story very well, you just don’t know it yet.Which I also found interesting – as I wasn’t totally sure what this book would be about before I started reading it. I did make a half-hearted start to it a life time ago in High School, but stopped very early on and never quite got back to it. I think I would have enjoyed this book  then than I did now.The character I found most interesting was good old Phoebe. It is interesting that he nearly constantly refers to her as old Phoebe when really she is much younger than him. She is his baby sister. But if this book is anything it is a hall of mirrors. One of the main distortions in the reality of what we might expect in this book was Phoebe. Holden’s first conversation with her is a real ‘out of the mouths of babes’ moment. We have just learnt that she has an extensive part in the school play and she (in a signalling piece of irony) is playing Benedict Arnold. Virtually her first act in the story is to selflessly protect her bother and put herself in danger of being punished for his sake. Also interesting is the fact that she tells Holden that he is constantly negative and completely without direction. It might be that she is just repeating what her parents have told her, all the same she comes across as one of ‘those’ children that one finds so often in novels; children who are far too old for their years.Holden’s dream of becoming the catcher in the rye, someone who essentially saves young children from accidental death caused by thoughtlessness, is also part of the mirror like distortions. Here is a young man on the cliff edge and his dream job is to catch and protect other young people in danger.This book was probably saved by being written in first person and by being seminal to the whole genre of stories about teenagers who don’t quite fit in, you know, all the way up to Donnie Darko. I think I enjoyed this book  than this review is really showing, but I think the book has probably dated and so it is much less shocking than I guess it would have been in 1950. All the same, how this book ends still does seem shocking to me. This is not a book about presenting solutions, and the solution that is being implemented at the end does not seem to be any sort of real solution. That this book could have become a classic confirms that it is not just a couple of us who felt alienated from the Real World while growing up. Perhaps the first sign of growing up is the day we realise that (in the immortal words of the Boomtown Rats) we should “Watch out for the normal people – there’s  of us than there’s of you!”Fortunately, Holden gets to be ‘treated’ at the end of this book and so everything is going to be just dandy – although, the kind of ennui he is suffering from is probably best cured by years than medication. This is the sort of teenage novel we are all too familiar with – a young man on the brink of adulthood suddenly released from the constraints of adult rules and thereby being able to ‘play’ at being an adult. Normally, in these teenage stories (even in the best of them, like The Graduate) we get to laugh – in this one reality is never far enough away for us to get a good belly laugh. This is not ‘the great teenage adventure’ – this is a book about dancing on the edge of the cliff and despite how much we might wish, there simply is no catcher in the rye waiting to save us.",

If you can't relate heavily to feelings of disassociation, isolation, and overall sadness/depression you'll find yourself hating this book and despising the main character as you won't be able to understand why Holden behaves and thinks the way he does.  I can't say with any certainty if you'll enjoy this novel or not. I can only recommend you give it a try because if you have ever felt any of the feelings Holden Caulfield deals with in this book you will have found a book that will mark a place in your heart forever.  As for my own personal feelings I read this book when I was around 14 and struggling with many issues. This book reassured me that someone out there felt the same things I do. Someone out there struggles with me. I'm not alone. And it still reassures me to this day at 19. And that's a pretty special book worth giving a chance to. “Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around - nobody big, I mean - except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff - I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be.”",

But seeing this is now the 21st century, it's not as bad now as it was then.Holden Caulfield comes from a rich family and faces many difficulties in his journey throughout the book. The story starts with him being unhappy and upset about everything and everyone around him. After being expelled from school, he decides not to go home and instead wanders around New York City all alone. During his time alone he experiences many mood shifts. He wants to fill his time doing something but he can’t do anything successfully. His depression, extreme happiness, arrogance, immaturity and restlessness makes it very hard for him to focus on one particular task. Troubled by the world, he faces severe alcoholism, deals with constant cigarette smoking and numerous mental breakdowns. This is a story about struggling to find one's place in the world, a lost teenager who probably does not want to be saved. The story is written in the first person which must have been challenging, but it is done in a way that the reader is captivated.However, considering the controversial topics, this book is not suitable for young kids. I agree that this book can be a ray of hope for some, who believe it is the end of the world after difficult situations but this book also comprises concepts that are misleading for the younger audience. I think this book expands your horizons on how and what a typical troubled teenager thinks. A small journey to the mind of one messed up but interesting character makes the readers realise that wandering alone is one essential part of growing up. ",

So now I can say that I've read this one... and ugh. Such a waste of my time. Two things got me through this trial: 1) The hope that there would be some redeeming something at the end that would have made it worth it. Unfortunately, there wasn't. Does Holden grow during the story? I thought I spotted a few glimmers of growth, but overall, he's a narcissistic hypocrite who is  phony than any number of the people he categorically judges on sight combined, 2) The Kindle app calculating my remaining reading time. It was like watching the time ticking away until Christmas or something... It seems like it's just NEVER going to get here. I can't even express how excited I was to get to the final countdown... 1 hour... 45 mins... 23 mins... ZERO minutes! :DAs I was reading this, I had thoughts of how I would write my review, full of repetition, repeating, and saying the same thing in seventeen different ways in less than a paragraph, and I'd throw in every single one of the the 395 I-am-not-exaggerating-I-did-a-search-and-there-were-three-hundred-and-ninety-friggin'-five instances in which Holden uses the phrase \"and all\" in this 277 page book. But I have no patience to imitate this book, considering that reading all of that was about as fun as having a root canal with no anesthetic. (Actually, that comparison is pretty funny, because I actually WAS at the dentist to have a root canal done the last time I read Salinger, and I had no qualms then about putting it down in favor of having my face drilled on. True story.)It's pretty amusing to me that my reading J.D. Salinger actually constitutes an endorsement for dental surgery. \"Thinking about reading Salinger? Save yourself some pain and irritation, and have a root canal instead! Anesthesia optional!\" So, yeah. There's not really much left for me to say about this. I pretty much hated every minute of reading it. I got nothing out of it. I didn't identify with Holden in any way, and I doubt that I was even jaded enough as a teen to have liked it then. Most likely, I would have just wanted to slap Holden less than I do now. But maybe not... I had less impulse control back then.Still... I'd like to redeem this coupon please.

It is easy to just read it at face value, as a straightforward “bildungsroman” story and just get off the ride at the end of it with a sigh of satisfaction (or alternatively frisbee it into the bin). I am always happy to do that when reading for pleasure. Still, at certain points in the book things insist on jumping out at me. Holden Caulfield’s thought processes are interesting. Here is a teenager who resents everything and everybody, including himself. Sound familiar? He is clearly an unreliable narrator but he can also be very perceptive and insightful, not to mention goddam hilarious. For example:“Every time you mention some guy that's strictly a bastard--very mean, or very conceited and all--and when you mention it to the girl, she'll tell you he has an inferiority complex.”Now I don’t necessarily agree that this is true “every time” but it seems true enough to make me laugh. Certainly the novel starts off being just a funny witty silly irreverent story. Gradually the humor becomes darker and there is a tonal shift into melancholia. The narrative never entirely shed its sense of humor though, but there is usually a bitter undertone to all the sarcasms.If you don’t enjoy character centric fiction this book is probably not for you. It is all about characters. Not just Holden Caulfield himself but his sister Phoebe who is amazingly well developed given her brief appearances in the story. Then there is the kindly teacher Mr. Antolini, whose observation about how an academic education will “give you an idea what size mind you have” will always stay with me.Salinger’s flippant colloquial narrative style (via Holden Caulfield) is a pleasure to read and comes across as quite heartfelt and sincere. It is very tempting to start aping this style and write a crumby phony review, but it would kill me I swear it would, so I won’t. I'll just tell you I got a big bang out of reading it and while I don't like to spend a lot of time analysing books The Catcher in the Rye made me think about certain issues so hard I wanna puke.For some reason I am now in the mood for some Van Halen.",

Holden: he was an aggravating asshole. The amount of times he said \"goddamn\" and \"phoney\" was highly irritating. The way he whinged about everything got tiresome. He whined about having to get up, having to walk anywhere, about every person he comes into contact with. You know, he whinged so much, I lost track of any potential plot buried deep in this book.

Of course, I was curious to see for myself what made him so celebrated a character, revered by teenagers world over. Naturally, TCITR was what came to my mind, at the thought of 'next book'. And, of course, I was flummoxed by the simplicity of the language used in the book. I kept looking at the title page to assure myself that I am holding the original book and not some bogus spinoff. I also found myself wishing  than once that it should be a spinoff- surely The Catcher in The Rye couldn't be that ridiculously juvenile. Reading the book was as tedious as reading a diary containing a miserable kid's incoherent scribblings. True to its notoriety, this book has received its share of sideswipes. I could understand what many people are trying to get at, but this book connected with me on many levels. ✅Straightforward language.My knowledge of English literature is limited to a paltry sum of one hundred books. For someone who had no proper knowledge of English until late teens, I had always imagined that all novels from around 1900s were as grandiloquent as The Fountainhead or Lolita(both of which I had the pleasure of reading recently). That's why Salinger's opus came as a pleasant blow- any book that doesn't have me rereading the same passage, willing it to make some sense, and doubling my reading time as a result, deserves plaudits. This book changed my perception of the writers based in the '40s' and '50s' entirely, and that's for good. ✅Antsy-teen exemplar Holden Caulfield.On the surface, TCITR feels like an enormous waste of time as Holden yammers about how he doesn't like anything that anyone does. The deep-rooted antagonism that Holden has for the world in general sets an ideal for a plethora of YA protagonists of today. Holden's tendency to brush off everything as fake establishes a dangerous trend for absolving oneself from his unwillingness to take responsibility for his own prevarication. We come across kids like Holden- \"kids on the loose\", I would like to call them- everyday. They are  precarious than a bandit brandishing a gun at us. Trying to knock some sense into their unyielding brains is like trying to save a drowning kid who is hell-bent on drowning. If you don't steer clear of these brats, you will end up drowning too. They are as fickle as wild animals, you have to tread cautiously around them. Or, you would meet the same fate as John Lennon(if you don't know the story already, you should Google it).But, maybe not everything is wrong with Holden's world as we are compelled into believing. He perceives the world as it is, better than we do.You take somebody that cries their goddam eyes out over phony stuff in the movies, and nine times out of ten they’re mean bastards at heart. I’m not kidding.If you are one of the persons that fails to earn Brownie points from Holden or get in his good books, then, maybe something is wrong with your world. That boy doesn't know a thing or two about living, but he certainly knows how to live it right.♛ Verdict:Old Holden Caulfield doesn't talk in codes and all. He means goddamn what he means. He gets a bang out of calling everybody a phony slob. Everybody who is a phony slob, that is. If you got goddamn dough and all, don't flaunt it. It kills him, my ass.

His constant repetition, whining, stating that he was depressed, stating that something 'kills him', etc. I get why repetition is used in books, but here it was just plain irritating (at least to me it was). The only reason why I gave this book 2 stars, instead of 1, was because I liked some parts of it, and I liked a couple of 'supporting' characters. And that's all. I really disliked the rest. I can sort of see why people would like this book, but the question that troubles me, is how can people actually like Holden? Is it maybe because of the meaning? I haven't got a clue.

I can see how it could be unlikeable. Holden is an annoying narrator. He vascilates from one opinion to the opposite in the span of a page, he rambles on often, he's got a low tolerance threshhold, and there are times he's just an ass. But, er, that's the point. If you don't like Holden, Salinger did his job.On the same token, I find it hard to hate Holden, because I see bits of me in him. Less now than when I look back on when I was his age, but I think most teens should be able to relate to Holden, especially male teens. If you can't, you're either incredibly well adjusted, and if that's the case, you lucked out, or you're the sort of person that drives someone to become Holden, jaded by everything before graduating High School, convinced everyone is phony... not that Holden himself isn't phony at times, but every teen is. The book isn't about events. The events are commonplace. They're supposed to be. It's about the character, and what he says, and to extrapolate, what it means. You could say it's cautionary, that Salinger is laughing at the spoiled rich brat he's writing Holden as, and that we the reader should take it as warning not to become him. We could see it as dystopian, that Salinger was commenting on the shallowness of American culture through the eyes of a child, one well-off enough to both see its most glaring pettiness as well as partake in it's seedier aspects. You could even see it as a bit of a commentary about what really matters... about how even the most cynical teen out there still has something they love (in Holden's case, family). You could even take that a step further, and see it psychologically... what damage a loss like that of Allie could cause in a young mind, etc. There's a lot to look into in The Catcher in the Rye... even the admittedly weak explaination of the title could spark discussion as to what it says about or means in terms of his character. These are just the impressions I get from it... hardly researched, but then, the best book discussions shouldn't come from research but from your heart. I just think that with many classics, people start looking for something huge... a big, rollicking plot, some amazing humour or poetic language, and sometimes the brilliance of a book is so much  subtle. Not that Holden can't turn a phrase, and certainly not to say that there are times when Holden's sheer contradictory nature jumps the line into humorous, and not even to say there aren't some big and poignant moments in the mundanity (word?) of the plot... simply that in a book like this, even those moneymaker bits are understated.

The way that the agency kept tabs on him was to implant this desire to purchase every copy of Catcher in the Rye that he came across – the reason being that their systems would monitor every bookshop for when that particular ISBN was scanned. As it turned out the guy that attempted to shoot then President Ronald Regan apparently had a connection with the book (at least according to Wikipedia). Anyway, after watching this movie I came across the book and curiosity got the better of me, particularly since I had never heard of it before, so I grabbed it and read it, though I should point out that my bookshelf doesn’t happen to be jam packed with this book – I only have the one copy.\tThe thing was, that first time I read it all those years ago, I was quite surprised as to how good it was. A part of me thought that since it was a plot piece in this okay, but not hugely fantastic movie, that it was just going to be some trashy novel – it turned out that it wasn’t, and in fact not only did it raise quite a bit of controversy when it was first published, but it is also one of those books that falls into the category of The Great American Novel (though I’ll leave that idea to the side for now). In fact, I so enjoyed the book on my first reading that when I started back-writing reviews for a lot of rather trashy books that I had read in the past I decided to leave this one so that I could do the review some justice by reading it again – the thing was that it has taken me quite a while to actually get my hands on another copy of the book.\tI’m sure many of us here know about the story of Holden Caulfield and how he drifts about New York City one December weekend before Christmas trying to work out the point of life, drowning in cynicism and his desire to simply say ‘stuff this’ and move out west and live as a hermit in a cabin. In fact, I’m sure all of us who are reading this review are either, or have been at one point in our lives, a teenager (though despite there being a minimum age limit for people to sign up to Goodreads I suspect that there are younger people here). Whether all of us have been through the soul searching confusion that Holden is going through is really only for the reader to know.\tI would say that the book is about the struggles one faces as one leaves the innocence of childhood and enters the world of the adult, but a part of me suspects that this isn’t necessary something that everybody in the world goes through, or has ever been through. The thing is that the concept of the teenager is actually a pretty modern concept, one that my English teacher suggested was created by the advertising industry to create a specific market in which to target specific products. Ironically, since he said that we have now seen the creation of the Tween – this stage of life when one is technically not a child, but not quite a teenager, and of course we have the youth, which is technically a person who is aged somewhere between eighteen and twenty-five (usually about university age).\tI suspect that the reason Caulfield goes through this stage (and many of us as well) is purely due to something that not many people have – choice. The thing is that in the pre-industrial age, and even in many places today, people simply didn’t have a choice, they simply did what their parents did, and what their parent’s told them to do. In fact, I suspect that there are many people in our own society that simply have done what their parent’s have told them to do simply because the choice is so immense that falling back into that safety net is so much easier than running the risk of making the wrong decision. Yet it is interesting to note how many middle aged people you run into that simply drift through life, miserable, because of choices that they made when they were younger and simply regret it – or are even in a situation, such as a debt trap, that they cannot escape from (or on the other hand, making a change to escape from where they are is just way, way too hard).\tThe question that roamed through my head as I was drifting through this weekend with Caulfield was where he ended up. A apart of me sees the drug addled beggars lining the streets of Melbourne and I could half imagine that that was where Caulfield would be, yet he seemed to have some sort of a plan, but it was a plan that simply involved drifting. The thing was that he lived in a time of full employment, and getting a job, any job, really wasn’t all that hard. However, I have also met people in my generation who simply took the first job offer that they were given and have simply sat in that role, well, forever, and are likely to die in that role – honestly, not everybody is ambitious, and sometimes being ambitious means that you will sacrifice your ethics simply to get ahead, and some people are just not like that. I guess for some people, simply having a job, and drifting through life in that job satisfies them. I have my opinions, but in the end if that is what makes them happy, or gives them purpose, then so be it.\tI’ll finish off with Caulfield’s comments about the phonies – this is something that we are regularly confronted with, and to be honest, I feel that Caulfield is right to be disgusted with that. The thing is that he his a person that is not only deep, but is real, and he expects everybody else to be like that as well. However, we live in a world were we walk around wearing masks, hiding our real selves behind a fantasy image that everything is going well and we are in control of our life. This has become so with the development of social media – we have also become marketers, marketing our life to put our best image forward. Okay, not everybody is necessarily like that, but quite a lot of us are (I known I am, but then again I have become pretty disenchanted with the whole Facebook thing – I suspect a bulk of its accountholders never actually use the site). In my mind I suspect Caulfield would either not have an account, or simply have created one but never used it.\tOh, there is also this section where Caulfeild mentions that the reason that he has never had sex is because the women always says stop, and when they tell him to stop, he stops. Honestly, this is good thing because there is a serious problem in our society, and not a day goes by when somebody on Facebook reminds the world that rape is rape and no certainly does not mean yes. I have to commend Caulfeild on actually stopping because it sounds like a lot of the guys that he knows won’t, and will continue through with the act. Sure, there is a lot of pressure amongst the guys to ‘get laid’ as they say, but the thing is that when a girl says no, she means it, and to push it further is rape – there is not other way around it. Honestly, peer pressure is one thing, and it is a horrible thing as well, but it will never, ever, justify what in the ends amounts of an assault on somebody else’s person.",
        "I could tell you about how Holden Caulfield is a hypocrite. I could tell you about how Holden Caulfield is a privileged, spoiled rich boy. I could tell you about how he is a pretentious, angsty teen. All these are true, but instead I am going to talk about something barely anyone talks about when it comes to this book, and something I don't think a lot of people realise: Holden Caulfield is a victim of childhood sexual abuse.It is the climactic scene with Mr Antolini that really made all the pieI could tell you about how Holden Caulfield is a hypocrite. I could tell you about how Holden Caulfield is a privileged, spoiled rich boy. I could tell you about how he is a pretentious, angsty teen. All these are true, but instead I am going to talk about something barely anyone talks about when it comes to this book, and something I don't think a lot of people realise: Holden Caulfield is a victim of childhood sexual abuse.It is the climactic scene with Mr Antolini that really made all the pieces click together for me. When Mr Antolini makes a pass at him, Holden says \"That kind of stuff's happened to me about twenty times since I was a kid.\" You can't brush this kind of comment off, especially when it comes from somebody so obviously troubled as Holden. Then I remembered about how angry Holden got when he thought about how Stradlater date-rapes girls. I remembered how uncomfortable Holden became when the prostitute made sexual advances towards him. I remembered how Holden talked about being terrified he was going to turn gay overnight. I remembered about Carl Luce, about how Holden tells us Luce 'taught' him all about 'perversity' and strange sexual encounters. The pieces fit together.Because everybody knows this book is about protecting the innocence of childhood. Holden wants to be the 'catcher in the rye'; he wants to save children from 'falling over the cliff'. He views innocence as the ultimate form of purity - because Holden's own innocence was robbed from him, by people who gained his trust and took advantage of him. This explains Holden's almost irrational hatred towards all adults. He no longer trusts them because they betrayed that trust.This book was written in the 1950s, and yet it contains such astronomically important lessons about consent and sexuality. Because for Holden Caulfield, no means no, and it will always mean no. Whenever he's with a girl and she says no, he tells us always that he immediately stops. \"They tell me to stop, so I stop.\" Because nobody stopped when Holden said stop. It's why he hated Stradlater so much - Stradlater is the epitome of a jock who thinks he is entitled to a girl because she agreed to go out with him, he is the proverbial 'locker room talk', and Holden hates everything that he stands for. This abuse most likely began when Holden was in school. \"You can't trust anybody in a goddamn school,\" he tells us. He becomes markedly upset when he sees obscene language written on the walls of his little sister's school. Holden cannot reconcile the fact that he is becoming an adult, because he is still stuck in limbo - he hasn't yet confronted his trauma. Holden is the ultimate unreliable narrator. He lies through his teeth to everybody around him, trying to act older than he is while simultaneously coming across so childlike. It's why a lot of people probably won't realise he is an abuse victim upon first reading: because he hasn't even been able to admit it to himself, so of course he isn't going to tell anybody around him. This is why he is in a mental hospital at the end of the novel: because he hasn't yet faced his trauma, and hasn't developed healthy coping mechanisms. I find myself hoping that somewhere along the line, he managed to get himself out of his place of limbo. I'm hoping he realised that he doesn't have to remain a child in order to be a good person.Holden sees himself as the 'catcher in the rye': the great defender of children. Because nobody defended him when he was a child.\"Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around - nobody big, I mean - except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff - I mean, if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from nowhere and catch them. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd like to be.\"",

I wish I could call up Salinger and tell him what an amazing story he wrote. I loved it so much!I don't think I have been  pleasantly surprised from a book this year than The Catcher in the Rye. I went into it with extremely low expectations because I read so many bad reviews and the Goodreads average rating is only 3.79. I had the mindset of \"let's just read this über-popular classic and get it over with.\" I never expected to come out loving it.For one thing, the language is so beautifully done. And I don't mean the swearing—though there's quite a bit of that—but the way our narrator, Holden Caulfield, presents himself and the other characters using the slang of the '50s. Through his observant eyes, Holden can't help seeing all the ugliness in the world around him alongside the beauty. Reading from someone who was both so wise and young was like a blast of cool, fresh air.“Among other things, you’ll find that you’re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior. You’re by no means alone on that score.”If you don't know, The Catcher in the Rye follows sixteen-year-old Holden who just got kicked out of a fancy prep school in Pennsylvania. From there he travels to New York for a few days, where he goes on a journey of meeting new people and self discovery.Holden was the ultimate symbol of teenage rebellion. He swore, smoked, drank, and was self-dependent, but deep down he was incredibly lonely. Though the things he did might be considered pretty tame today, the edgy mood and feeling were still there. He felt like no one understood him, which I think most teens can relate with.I think Holden is relatable to many because he symbolizes change. Even if you're not a teenager going through the awkward phase of growing up, people are constantly changing throughout their whole life. They get a new job, they get married, they move to a new house, they have kids. Holden represents all of the sorrow and loss and joy that comes with change. The label \"coming of age\" gets slapped lightly on so many YA books these days, but what does it actually mean? It signifies an important time when children are becoming adults, which this book brilliantly explores.Is this the ultimate coming of age novel? In my opinion, yes. Holden was one of the most interesting characters I've ever come across. Cynical and brutally honest as he was, he made me giggle at many of his humorous observations about people, but his perspective was also a truthful, sobering one.",

I've read this book twice before. Each time, including this time, it's been new to me. I can't tell you why, exactly. Part of that, no doubt, is that I forget. Part, is rifling through it too quickly the first go round, and another part is that there have been new things to see with the different age of my life. This time, when I got passed some of those Caulfield mannerisms ( accustomed to them is the better way of putting it), the questions came: What are you telling me Holden? Why don't you want to move on with life? Sixteen years old and he's carrying this huge weight around. He's at that tender age, drifting on the cusp between childhood and adulthood, and you get that feeling that he's ready to check out of it all in a moment. Hunting between all those words he throws out, which read like a barrier of sorts, you suddenly come across the loss he's experienced. It's an unexpected glimpse through a partially open door.The door is opened further when Holden meets his kid sister Phoebe. She is his one tether, and in these moments the name of the book is understood. It's a favorite title of mine.”She was right, though. It is “If a body meet a body coming through the rye.” I didn't know it then though.\t “I thought it was, 'If a body catch a body,'” I said. “Anyway, I keep picturing these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all.

I'll forget some things, but hopefully not that feeling near the end when Holden is with his sister. Because of that, I'll look forward to the next time I read The Catcher in the Rye, in another dozen years or so, knock-on-wood.",

Sometimes, when I finish reading a book I go to booktube, which is one of my sources of information about new releases. Plus, there’s a great deal of very knowledgeable, talented readers, and it’s the kind of thing I can listen to while doing some other menial tasks – like getting dressed for dinner, which incidentally was what I was doing when I caught myself listening to this booktuber’s view. This opinion is relevant not because of any particular feelings I might have regarding their channel, but because it seemed to be symptomatic of a common interpretation regarding this novel. Their argument goes that Holden Caulfield is a dislikeable character. They cite Holden’s hypocrisy, his adherence to norms and things he claims to hate, his misogyny and general misanthropy, and last but not least, his desire to be the only adult in the room. In the reviewer's point of view, Holden believes himself to be the only proper, intelligent adult, the most mature person in every room and situation, the only one that knows how to be behave – how not to be phony. I thought this line of interpretation was relevant because some people told me this book it doesn’t age well. Most people in America read it in their teens and it’s apparently marketed as a book about teenage angst and the struggle of a young boy on the verge of adulthood. This reviewer I mentioned claims this book could be classified as a Young Adult novel because the themes it touches are similar to those in YA literature. I disagree completely. Holden Caulfield is a teenager, yes, but the book itself wasn’t written by a teenager. It was written by a 25 year old, and it reads precisely as that – as an adult writing about adults from the point of view of a teenager. A teenager he may have once been, yes, but that doesn't seem relevant. The Catcher in the Rye is about a boy soon-to-become a man who is completely disillusioned with most people he encounters. And this point of view can only be had in hindsight. It’s not Salinger thinking about what he felt as a teenager but what he – an adult – feels about the world he has experienced so far. What Holden classifies as “phony” is merely the hypocrisy of adult interactions, something he himself must comply with because he is part of society. And that, to use his expression, kills him. Holden’s unhappiness and sense of displacement – his “alienation” – doesn’t come from a lack of understanding about his place in society or his future; on the contrary, it’s because he understands all too well what the world demands of him.What really is extraordinary about this character is that he keeps telling you what he really is. At first, he might seem dislikeable and insensitive – but that’s  a matter of form, of how Holden uses language, than content. It seems to me that Holden Caulfield understands people very well. He is extremely sensitive and perceptive. I would argue that he’s not immature at all. His bouts of emotional instability have little to do with his age and  with fact that he seems to be clinically depressed, something probably owed to the death of his younger brother. His younger brother and younger sister are still innocent, and Holden wants them to remain that way. Not because he doesn’t want to grow up; he knows that’s inevitable. But because he cannot deal with the world of adulthood and its false pretenses. Children are simpler, they say what they mean and do what they want. There’s no fakeness, no hypocrisy. Holden doesn’t want to return to that himself, but he wants to be near it. His problem is not that he’s on his way to become an adult, but that he is forced to deal with so many of them. His solution, his solace, is not a return to childhood, but rather the idea of escape, of solitude – which is a very adult idea. The conscious desire for solitude, for a simple life, for a cabin in the woods, a mechanic job, an escape to nature are not childish or childlike desires. Some children flee from home but they rarely imagine themselves living in a house in the middle of nowhere while working at a gas station. Holden’s desire for solitude is a budding adult desire. The adult he isn’t yet, but that he is about to become.Yes, I enjoyed this book. Holden Caulfield is a fascinating character, no matter how you read him, or how one choses to analyze him. I’ll definitely read  of Salinger this year as I’m very curious about his later writings. Needless to say, if you haven’t read The Catcher in the Rye, please do.",

The quality of the writing is exceptional. WPound for pound, The Catcher in the Rye would win the American novella category and rank highly among all the novels I have read to date.First-person narrator Holden Caulfield is America's first literary teenager, opening the door for a new genre, the teenage confessional. Like East of Eden, Ordinary People, The Outsiders and Rebel Without a Cause, The Catcher in the Rye authentically portrays the struggles of teenage boys in a certain place and time. The quality of the writing is exceptional. While first-person point of view can be a challenge for young readers, the authenticity of the narrator's voice and the book's compactness make it  accessible. A lot happens in four days trapped inside Holden's head.Holden doesn't give a hoot about \"fitting in\" with his teenage peers. He's fed up with their phoniness and shallow values. He is striving mightily to be an adult, experimenting with adult behaviors like social drinking, smoking, dancing at a nightclub with women much older than him, initiating conversation with adults like the woman on the train, the cabbies, the nuns, a former upper classmate, a former teacher and even a prostitute. The source of Holden's unhappiness is his 'tween status, stuck between adolescence and adulthood. His disaffection with his former peer group results in his groping for a place/identity among adults. He is unwittingly on a quest, an exploration for his place among adults. Having rejected his former place among the the Pencey crowd and not yet found a comfortable place among adults, he feels lonely, stuck in a \"twilight zone.\" Holden isn't \"fitting in\" because he's outgrown people like his suitemates Stradlater and Ackley and girlfriend Sally Hayes and the creeps who stole from him and the ones who bullied James Castle in to committing suicide. He's ready to move on, but where? Holden is like the pond \"half-frozen, half-not frozen,\" stuck in a discomfort zone. Limbo. Even a former teacher lets him down, or so he thinks. One thing he cherishes over everything else is innocence, and that's what saves him--coming home to his adoring, brilliant, optimistic, unsoiled little sister, Phoebe. And she rescues him, reassures him of his value to her with her non-judgmental loyalty and love.The Catcher in the Rye can be seen as a young adult novel or an adult novel about the teenager within us all, a lament on the necessary loss of innocence on the way to adulthood. You can't read it as an adult without getting personality insights that were impossible as a teen because teens are by definition living within the transitional state exemplified in Holden. They can't see it as transitional because it's the only reality they know, the fog they are living within. Caterpillar, pupa and butterfly are different states of being. The vast majority of teens are emerging from pupae-ville, just starting to sample the sights and smells of the world. For them, death--James Castle's mangled body--is an abstract notion, something in a video or book or some stage or screen rendition of Romeo and Juliet. The average teen has never been in the presence of a lifeless body and smelled death's pungent vapors--well, maybe a frog in biology class--let alone lost a beloved sibling.Only an adult can look back on their teenage years with perspective, yet academia keeps throwing The Catcher in the Rye at teenagers because of what it says about the challenges of growing up.The Catcher in the Rye depicts an upper-middle-class male in an urban setting going through a crisis. He's overwhelmed by the pressures of becoming an adult, but too much has been thrown at him at once. He hasn't gotten over the death of his beloved younger brother, Allie, when he witnesses the suicide of a dormitory mate, James Castle. He's been traumatized and can't function. How much can a guy take?He's looking for answers and can't seem to get them, like Conrad Jarret in Ordinary People and Jim Stark in Rebel Without a Cause. All three boys struggled with the death of people they cared about.And the one person Holden respects and looks to for help, Mr. Antolini, he mistakes for a pervert, a threat. It's too much; so Holden withdraws. He wants to go live in a cabin in the woods, which is a metaphor for \"Time-out! I need a break!\" Phoebe rescues him with unconditional love. She accepts him no matter what. If she'd been a brat,the message would have been entirely different.Holden goes from being antagonistic and callous to highly empathetic. He wants to protect children from the brutal realities of adulthood. But the trip has been too exhausting and he ends up in a rest home.Cal, in East of Eden is similar to Holden--acting out, raging, doing strange things. But all four of these books/films are about males. The world of teenage girls is different; so all the guy stuff (fighting, jealousy, possessiveness, etc.) may not come across for the female reader.I reread the book at age 67 and discovered that Holden could be suffering from PTSD stemming from the death of his brother and from witnessing the suicide of dorm-mate James Castle, who bailed out of a dorm window wearing the sweater Holden had loaned him. The symptoms Holden was exhibiting: depression, poor concentration, attention deficit, crying, uncontrollable rage, lack of motivation, self-isolation, sleeplessness, etc., are typical of PTSD. To me The Catcher in the Rye is partially about a kid struggling against the downward spiral of mental illness. Without professional help he was doomed to submerge, and did. Holden was barely \"holdin' on.\"There's a lot of cultural and psychological meat in there: a) how boys interact with each other when living in close quarters, b) particularly when two have or are dating the same girl (Jane Gallagher)and one feels protective or possessive of her, c) how a sensitive boy might behave because of a deep emotional wound and d) how that boy might become neurotically protective toward his younger sister and toward children in general because of c).Most teenagers aren't mature enough to comprehend the psychological ramifications of what I've just described unless they've been prepared for it by a mature adult who does comprehend. And there are many adults who can't.Most adults have psychological defenses that don't allow even them to comprehend what I've just described. It's either too abstract, too complicated or too scary. I suspect this is the main reason the book is so controversial. Most people don't get it unless someone points the way.A greater sense of Holden Caulfield through JD Salinger can be found in the film Finding Forester, which is purported to be based on Salinger's life. The reclusiveness of Forester appears rooted in the trauma of losing his beloved brother in a car crash.In World War II, Salinger was at Utah Beach at Normandy and at bloody major campaigns like the Battle of the Bulge, where Allied troops were decimated. He was among the first Allied troops to liberate a German concentration camp. He was hospitalized for battle fatigue; he understood first-hand the effects of trauma.In a 1953 interview with a high-school newspaper, Salinger said that the novel was \"sort of\" autobiographical: \"My boyhood was very much the same as that of the boy in the book ...it was a great relief telling people about it.\"Salinger, when writing The Catcher in the Rye wouldn't have had a clue about PTSD, as it wasn't even in the diagnostic manual (DSM) for psychologists until decades later. He was just writing what he felt, blasting his feelings onto paper and letting the chips fall.Many people see Salinger as a sort of literary genius because he sold 70 million copies of one book. I'm not saying he wasn't talented and educated; he had plenty of both going for him. I'm saying he leveraged his talent on top of some inner need to get this desperate crisis part of his life onto paper and out of his head.A great segment of the literary world has quite understandably interpreted Holden's PTSD symptoms as mere teenage angst, but this is a gross oversimplification. It is his masterfully presented array of extreme symptoms that is largely responsible for the success of the book.It's too complicated, or too sensitive, for English teachers to talk about mental illness; so they focus on the simple and  obvious interpretation. Such teachers are missing a phenomenal opportunity to reach kids who are in crisis or know someone who is. We'd have fewer cases of teenagers going postal if The Catcher in the Rye were used for exploring mental illness.One point of the book is the redemptive power of unconditional love, revealed and brilliantly illustrated in the climax scene at the carousel.Even at Phoebe's tender age, she knew how to get her point across. On the way to the carousel she digs in her heels, throws a fit, making Holden promise not to run away. Because of the depth of her devotion, Holden realizes she's doing it because she loves him, wants him to be safe and come home and return to school.This revelation makes him so happy he begins to cry. He shows his love for Phoebe by fussing over her, making sure she gets a good seat, watching over her as the tears stream down his face in the rain. Teenage guys are supposed to be tough, but he's \"practically bawling.\" And as if that weren't enough, Salinger practically spells it out with those two songs (\"Oh Marie\" and \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\".)Holden wanted Sally Hayes to run away with him, but all she wanted was someone to trim the Christmas tree, skate and go to the theater with. All Jane Gallagher wanted was someone to play golf and checkers and hold hands with in a movie. The raw fierceness of Phoebe's simple, innocent devotion redeemed Holden by showing him that among all the \"phoniness\" and flaws of mankind there is a niche of happiness if we open our eyes and hearts to the possibility.There was no one in Holden's life--not parents, not friends, not teachers, to let Holden know he was loved--except Phoebe. She proved her love by standing her ground to keep him safe. Phoebe represents family, clan or tribe. People are social creatures, like most higher forms of the animal kingdom capable of love. Love is a bonding emotion with survival implications.If a writer has to STATE the obvious, it ruins it for the reader, cheats the reader of that glorious \"Ah-ha\" moment of discovery, or worse, insults the reader's intelligence. But by not spelling it out, he/she runs the risk that some readers won't get it. Herein lies the artistry--the use of symbol (ducks, fish), metaphor (pond), mood setting (rain).Salinger strikes a balance between showing and telling, with the knowledge that some readers will get it and others will walk away shaking their heads, or come up with interpretations he had not intended. We tend to find what we are capable of seeing, or need to.Nature symbols are used sparingly but effectively. Ducks flying south and the \"part frozen, and part not frozen\" pond can symbolize Holden's transitional state--neither boy nor man. The fish symbolize nature, a reminder that a natural process (\"Mother Nature\") is taking place. The seasons come and go; we live; we die; we get sick; we get well; we get hurt; we heal. Are the Central Park ducks there to remind us that to survive and thrive we must stick together? You decide.A final word on the so-called \"Peter Pan\" interpretation of Holden. I find little support in the text for the position that Holden was resisting growing up.The passage often cited as evidence for the Peter Pan perception concerns the naked-breasted squaw diorama at the museum. Holden: The best thing, though, in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was. . . . You could go there a hundred thousand times, and that Eskimo would still be just finished catching those two fish, . . . and that squaw with the naked bosom would still be weaving that same blanket. Nobody’d be different. The only thing that would be different would be you.In an article in the October 14, 2014, The New York Times Sunday Review of Books, author Mendelshon says, \"The all-too-evident regret in that last sentence is striking — one of the novel’s many markers of Holden’s problem, which is a refusal to grow up.\" What regret? There is nothing in the text that conveys regret. Mendelshon may be projecting from his own history or it could be academic influence, some popular professor's interpretation that caught on because it was easy to relate to.Practically everyone, Youtube star John Green included, parses out this naked-breasted squaw passage and Holden's liberal use of the word \"phony\" as evidence Holden doesn't want to grow up, while overlooking a mountain of evidence to the contrary.Holden smokes, drinks, lies about his age, critiques theater and music performances, frequents museums, hires a prostitute, repeatedly seeks out adult conversation with peer-level engagement, acts protectively toward children. How many examples are needed to prove Holden is experimenting with adulthood? Criticizing adults as phony means he's evaluating adult behavior, not resisting. This is engagement, not avoidance.Note further that Holden never seeks advice from his parents, or even thinks about it. Not consulting parents shows independence of mind, the embrace of maturity, not dependency or disengagement from the responsibilities of adulthood. Holden expresses compassionate concern about his mother, indicating that she hasn't been the same since Allie died. Compassion toward a grieving parent is adult thinking.It shouldn't escape notice that Holden was also eagerly embracing the dessert of adulthood--sex, smoking, booze, nightclub music, dancing, flirting, dating, literature and the dramatic arts--while agonizing over the spinach of social hypocrisy and rationalization.So, how DO we interpret Holden's comment about the bare-breasted Native American?The key is in that last sentence, underlined above: \"The only thing that would be different would be you.\" Holden is telling us he is aware that he is changing. This level of intuitive self-reflection is adult thinking. It also shows maturity to appreciate that \"some things don't change and never should,\" because they are part of our cultural identity.Nostalgic awareness is mature thinking. Mature people want to protect and preserve cultural icons.Think of the loss and disorientation after the Twin Towers were destroyed. Icons like the Statue of Liberty are signposts reminding us of who and where we are. Holden was feeling lost. In his agitated state he desperately needed that bare-breasted squaw to be right where she had always been. That's all he was getting at with his comment. You Peter Pan theorists, give the kid a break and stop projecting your own history onto him.Holden pondered and wrote down the Wilhelm Stekel quote Mr. Antollini gave him: \"The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one.\" This is another sign he was putting a lot of serious and strenuous thought into growing up.There are teenagers and even some adults, who resist growing up because their parents don't want to let go. They've been infantalized, encouraging dependency. Holden shows no evidence of having been infantalized. Quite the contrary, sending a kid to a military-style prep school could be evidence that Holden was too independent and possibly hard to control.Many readers are perplexed by the book, for it is way over the heads of many, even some who teach literature. The book must be read slowly and thoughtfully in order to absorb its meaning.The Catcher in the Rye even gets into the very meaning of life in the Stekel quote. You can shrug your shoulders and flip the page or you can sit and ponder what it means, which could take days. Many readers, teens in particular, resist the novel because of the it's capacity to trigger self-reflection. It resonates with their own transition from juvenile to adult, a vital period for personality development, when boys and girls become men and women and are confronted with one another's sexuality and the struggle to think and \"be\" independent from their parents.Check out the date rape scene in Ed Bankey's car when Holden overhears Stradlater abusing a girl in the back seat. You can't just blast through that scene without stopping to ponder your own early dating experiences. The evidence on the page shows that Holden was not resisting adulthood; he was aggressively embracing it. Holden was no Peter Pan.The book is a masterpiece of art and insight. Who will ever get into the head of a teenage boy so deeply, so thoroughly and with such an authentic and authoritative voice?(More about me at: ",

It’s almost impossible to finish this book without having that sentence engraved in your thoughts, forever. The Catcher in the Rye was one of my most surprising reading experiences yet. It’s not your conventional young adult story. It is a book that has known censorship before embracing immense fame. It’s popularity grew at an exponential speed and ended up getting incredible praise among teenagers. How? It was all in Holden Caufield, the protagonist of The Catcher in the Rye, and how so many adolescents were able to relate with him. This story is a glimpse into the life of Holden Caufield. He narrates the events, one after the other, and puts forth his entire thought process in black and white. After learning that he once again got kicked out of high school, Holden Caufield decides to follow his gut feeling and takes a trip to New York City. Through these events, readers uncover a child who’s simply falling into adulthood. In this story marinating in a theme of coming of age, Holden Caufield is an elegy for adolescents. It’s through his confusion, his angst, his pain, his pleasures and his desires that we see his struggle to remain a child, yet swimming in a world of adults.As I was reading, I thought I was going to end up hating this book. Everything about it seemed to be paving the way for the hate to roar out of me. There’s no exposition, there’s no climax, there’s no denouement and there’s no ending. The whole book is a sequence of actions told through the voice of Holden Caufield and his particular writing style. His hypocritical behavior, his cynicism, his repetitive language, his sarcasm, his swearing and his ability to digress are all there to strain you and build your patience for this character. You wouldn’t believe me if I told you the number of times he might have gotten on my nerves. Just his abusive use of “that killed me” would give me a brain aneurysm. Although it was somehow compelling to read about Caufield’s thoughts on a person or on a thing in particular, you always felt like he wasn’t leading you anywhere. His ability to digress is absolutely stunning. He could see a person at a bar and end up bringing you on a journey through memory lane. It’s only after finishing The Catcher in the Rye that it hit me. I actually did enjoy this. I actually did appreciate the thoughts of Holden Caufield and the way J.D. Salinger delivered this cynical child’s story. I actually did understand what Holden Caufield was going through. I felt like I had told parts of my own childhood to him and fell in this trap of getting attached to him. In the end, Holden Caufield was right. “Don’t ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody.”Holden Caufield is without a doubt the biggest phony out there. But why he is such a person is where things become so much  interesting. There isn’t a moment throughout the book that you won’t see him pointing fingers to every phony out there. Even in today’s society, there’s no denying the number of people who put on a farce and pretend to be someone they’re not or say things that they don’t honestly believe in. Even if Holden Caufield is able to see through these people, making it even  obvious that his adulthood is catching up to him, he does the exact same thing throughout the book. In fact, he blatantly admits to being one of the biggest liars out there. But it’s this irony and this contradiction that makes his adolescent self so intriguing. The way he perceives life brings him to alienate himself from the world and not bother with people who can’t stay true to themselves. In fact, I found that Holden is a strong believer of talking from the heart, of saying things that bring your excitement and leaves you in a peaceful trance. But what he believes and what he does are two completely different things, since he too has difficulties expressing himself or even a disinterest to do so. Holden Caufield is a very complex character who’s easily seen by many readers as a rebel who doesn’t want to do things that he doesn’t feel like doing. His desire to live in the present and to do things that simply pop into his mind makes his adventures so spontaneous.It’s heartwarming to see Holden Caufield want to preserve the childhood of every kid out there. Without explicitly saying so, you can tell from his behaviors and beliefs that it is something very important for him, especially when he’s starting to realize that he had already fallen off the cliff. His wish to be that person to stop others from falling off the cliff into adulthood is something that can easily strike a chord among readers. Even if Holden Caufield remains the biggest phony in this story, he somehow managed to make me like the guy. The Catcher in the Rye has been a controversial novel that has managed to join the list of banned books in history. It’s depiction of a cynical teenager who tackles themes of sexuality, drinking, profanity and many other things has made this a book that could stir the morals and values of a lot of individuals. Just to make it even  shocking, I’ve read that this book has even made the headlines alongside killers. The biggest story related to The Catcher in the Rye is the death of John Lennon. Mark David Chapman, the infamous killer who took Lennon’s life, was arrested with a copy of this book bought on the same day he killed him. Inside the book he left this note: “To Holden Caufield, From Holden Caufield. This is my statement.” Now, is being able to relate to the character a good or bad thing? I’ll let you find out.Yours truly,Lashaan | Blogger and Book ReviewerOfficial blog:  is a goddamn phony.

        "In junior high I had a crush on a guy about two years older than I was who rode the same bus. He had curly dark hair, and wore black sweaters and always carried a notebook that he scribbled in. Poems? Personal essays? I never dared to ask. \"So Byronic!\" I would have sighed, had it been a couple of years (and about fifty Marion Chesney romances) later. So this guy, let's call him Byron since I have many Goodreads friends from Rexburg, was reading this book on the bus one day. \"Oh,\" I said, daringIn junior high I had a crush on a guy about two years older than I was who rode the same bus. He had curly dark hair, and wore black sweaters and always carried a notebook that he scribbled in. Poems? Personal essays? I never dared to ask. \"So Byronic!\" I would have sighed, had it been a couple of years (and about fifty Marion Chesney romances) later. So this guy, let's call him Byron since I have many Goodreads friends from Rexburg, was reading this book on the bus one day. \"Oh,\" I said, daring to speak to him, wanting him to know that I, too, was a Reader, \"I haven't read that yet. What is it about?\"Byron looked up at me and sighed. \"It's not for a CLASS. I'm just reading it.\"\"Ah, yes?\" My little heart went pitter pat. I, too, read books that weren't for class! This was Meant to Be.\"It's about a kid who wanders through New York, wondering where the ducks on the pond go in the winter,\" Byron finally said.Pause.\"He wonders where the ducks on the pond go in the winter?\" What? I tried for witty. \"My guess is south!\" Ha ha ha ha!Sigh. \"It's not ABOUT the ducks.\" Turns back to the book.\"What is it about then?\" No answer.Byron spent the rest of the school year reading CATCHER IN THE RYE on the bus. He looked so deep and artistic in his black sweaters, reading that deep and artistic book. Years later I would realize that he was faking it. The book is less than 300 pages long. He was either the world's slowest reader, or he was just carrying it around to look edgy. By then I was so over him anyway. That was pretty much the only time I ever talked to him, and two months later he told a mutual friend that I bugged him constantly on the bus. Exsqueeze me? Baking powder? And then I went to high school, and I discovered something about THE CATCHER IN THE RYE. It was a prop. It was what kids carried around to look rebellious and intellectual. The book wasn't banned at our school, it was actually on every reading list for just about every English class. They just never taught it in class, because in Rexburg no teacher would dare to require students to read a book that had swears, smoking, and drinking it. There were even rumors of . . . SEX! I've just shocked you all, I know. No regrets.Several of my completely normal friends read it for their outside reading in Jr Honors or AP English. They didn't start smoking cigarettes and calling everyone phonies. But then there were the kids who did. The kids who carried it outside their backpacks all the time, for months and months, but wouldn't talk about it if you mentioned it. The implication was that you weren't smart enough, or cool enough, to understand it on the level that they did. They were reading it as part of their plan to Stick it to the Man, not because they needed to write another essay for Mrs. Johnson.So I pretty much wanted no part of that. I challenged my friend Cade (real name!) to a contest to see who could read the most books off the AP list. He won. (I think the score was 37-43.) I don't think either of us read THE CATCHER IN THE RYE. I went to college. It was never required, because I was in the Humanities. And I was fine. And then a few years ago it started to bother me that when I saw beautiful, exciting lists of classic books, or great American novels, I had read so few of them! And I decided to rectify that!So here we are.And I, for one, am glad that I read this book now, and not back then. I am also 99.9% sure that Byron and the rest of his ilk did not understand it. This is not a book about sticking it to the Man. This is a book about loss, and being lost. It's interesting to see now how many books there are like this. John Green has become a bestseller writing about disaffected, chain-smoking teenage intellectuals. But in 1950? No, this was not something that you saw. I can understand why it struck a nerve, and why it's stayed current. It was fairly undated, with the exception of a couple of slang terms. I honestly thought I would hate it, and I didn't. I quite, quite liked it. I mean, it's never going to be in my top ten, but I was surprised by how much I liked it. And how much I liked Holden, and how much I worried about him. He was truly a lost soul. Broken by his grief for his brother Allie, feeling abandoned by his older brother, dumped at a series of boarding schools by his parents, he needed someone to connect with, to talk to, to care about him. And the book is all about him. Where he goes and what he does doesn't matter, the point of the book is that you are watching him come undone. That and making you look cool carrying it around I guess.",

I think I might have liked the book better if I had not picked it up having heard for years how life changing it was.\"Catcher in the Rye\" is redundant, irritating, and so introspective at times as to be an unlikable reading experience, but I think that was Salinger's point. The novel's protagonist (Holden Caulfield) is a typical teenage navel gazer who derides everyone else for being part of the problem, while never taking the time to look in the mirror. He is unlikable and selfish although in his heart he does not want to be either of those things. And I guess that is why in the end I like this novel. Holden is a person who wears many masks, but he does not want to. He yearns for real human connection, but he does not know how to create it. That is a problem that most people can relate to. Throw into the mix Holden's questionable sexuality, the death of a younger brother, his painful feelings of isolation and loneliness, and you have one very sad character, and one very human story.This book is not a novel that has an especially interesting plot, or any sort of convenient conclusion. However it is an interesting study in character, and in that most basic of human desires, the ability to connect with others, and the pain that often follows when you allow yourself to love and be loved.I am almost positive I would not have appreciated this book as a teenager, and I am glad that I waited many years before reading it. I would recommend reading it with others so that you can discuss it, and get past its unlikable characters. In a group dynamic  of the novel's humanity will come out and your appreciation of it will be better.On a side note, the way that Mr. Salinger incorporates the novel's title is very touching, and I think a very important theme of the text.

Nevertheless, my unpopular opinion hasn't changed, and it is that I don't like this book at all. I'm not saying it's worthless as a work of literature (I'm not in a position to make any such claim) or that it's not worth reading for anyone. But I've read it quite a few times (at least three times in full throughout the years) hoping to like it and I never did. Not when I was 13, not 16, not 20. Holden whines and whines and whines and wants everyone to know what a cynical young man he is. I don't have a single ounce of empathy for him. I like some angsty protagonists, but not this one. In a character-driven book like this, it's hardly possible for me to keep going if I can't be bothered to care for anything the main character thinks, feels, says, and does. In some cases where I don't like the protagonist, I can still give the book credit If the writing is particularly sublime; not in this case. This book doesn't have and isn't supposed to have jaw-dropping prose. It falls even short of Salinger's own standard.

Yeah, me neither.This is the book my history teacher described as the quintessential book of the 1950’s. I remarked that we were reading it in English currently. My history teacher laughed and asked how many of us already wanted to slap Holden by page 10. Many of the kids laughed and eagerly nodded along.I was probably the only one who was never once tempted to slap Holden, or to tell him to just grow up, or yell at him to get his shit together. To be honest, I kinda wanted to give the guy a hug.Holden Caulfield is a 16 year old boy, and like many of us at 16, he is struggling immensely with the fact that he is growing up. Coping (well, actually not coping at all) with the loss of his brother and continually being kicked out of schools for poor grades, Holden takes off for a few days in New York City rather than heading home and having to face the disappointment of his parents yet again.This book surprised me so much. I could see how much thought was put into the story. I mean, it’s so symbolic. When one of our essay options was to write an entire essay just on Holden’s hat, you know this book has depth. I went back and found some insane foreshadowing as well. It has so many opportunities to create brilliant discussions between readers.I think the story has a unique character voice and Holden is incredibly developed and complex. He’s not a perfect person; he’s judgemental, impulsive, and can be horrible to those around him.But, to be honest, I saw myself a bit in Holden. Okay, a lot. Occasionally I did stop and think to myself please tell me I don’t sound like this. Holden struggles so much to perceive the world around him, realizing as he grows up just how dark it can be. Maybe it’s because Holden and I are at similar ages, finding our places in the world.I just loved the overall tone of this story, which could be funny but also had this somber undertone that made the story seem beautiful beyond its crude language and angry narrator. It was those sad little passages that reflected the complexity of life that made me fall in love with this story.I also am kind of astonished that there was a mental health themed story out at this time. Holden, no doubt, is suffering from depression. I love mental health novels, so that was just an added bonus.This book is a character study at its best. Plot? Nah. This book is just about Holden running around New York, not really doing anything, but that’s completely fine by me. Some of the best stories just explore life without much happening.That reminds me; this book reminds me so much of one of my all time favorite novels, The Spectacular Now. Honestly, so similar; both coming of age character studies about a spiraling teenage boy. Love both of them, so if you love one I imagine you’ll at least enjoy the other.Also, is this technically the first YA book? I’ve heard that title go to The Outsiders many times, but this book is 30 years older and most definitely YA if you ask me.Anyway, I’m really glad I read this book. I love Holden so much that I had a hard time in class not taking personal offense after anyone in class insulted him lol. Try not to be turned off by the first few pages.

        "\"God, I wish you could've been there.\" I enjoyed the hell out this reread. I didn't write a review when I first read this about 6-7 years ago and I'm not going to now. We all know it's polarizing. You either identify with Caulfield or you don't. I have a son named Holden so I think you know where I stand. ☺️",

Usually it's just there for dramatic effect. \"You'll never forget this story, this story will haunt you for life....,etc\", but this one actually has proven true. I read this months ago and now that I'm adding the reviews to the blog from Goodreads and my mental reservoir, I have to say that this book truly has never left me. I think of it at least once every two weeks. I have no idea why really, but I think there's such a total genuineness about it that it really gets inside you.The book isn't perfect because of the bizarre writing style, which would turn some off. I know some don't even keep going. You should push through any awkward growing pains, though, as it did prove to be so rewarding. The main character of Holden Caulfield is hard to get into at first, since he initially seems to be a smart-alek, dirty-mouthed, negative kid who doesn't care about much. It becomes clear after awhile he's troubled, lonely, compassionate, and actually a sweetheart.You end up feeling for him, caring about what happens, and trying to figure out how he can turn himself around, or if he even wants to and has reason enough to try. He is certainly not the typical character to read about, and this type of character is another reason I feel reading fiction encourages the growth of empathy in people so much.The scene that really stands out to me is the sadness of the hotel room scenario between Holden, the girl, and her pimp. How tragic and I felt for him as his youth really came through.It's a completely character-orientated novel. There's a strange opening to the book where not much is going on, and little ever happens action-wise. It's mainly an introverted thinking novel. You don't get the sense that the boy is troubled until a few chapters in, other than he's failing out of school. I would have liked a longer ending also, to see his parents reactions and  details of what happened next.Overall this is a worthy classic - I felt for the character and thought it held interesting insight. Language is pretty graphic so some parents may not want their kids reading it if too young. There's no sex or anything violent, although their are several adult implications. For the life of me I can't understand some of the blame from criminals on this book - the person is troubled, fragile, and lonely, but they are not violent, twisted, or evil.I rated this four stars after I read it because of some of the overly long paragraphs and ramblings got a bit much sometimes, and I would have enjoyed a little  action and thought editing slightly would have helped. However, if I rated it now from memory alone would have went for the big 5-star label. It's just one of those books that truly stays with you.",

In the end, I like Holden, because he decides to examine his sorrows and losses to a minimal degree, but he annoys the crap out of me through most of the book. This famous novel is definitely not a girl's coming of age story (women when young share feelings, generally, even if only to a doll or a journal and know, mostly, why we feel mean or crappy eventually. We're made to feel like those feelings shouldn't be felt, too, but I think generally girls KNOW exactly what they are feeling.) Some of Holden's misdirected rage reminds me of how real men still handle issues today - which pretty much sucks just like Holden's methodology. While the author's skill is tremendous in defining the internal trauma of a 1950's-era boy unable to process his pain, the self-destructive blown-up wretchedness makes me angry at Holden for his stupidity and self-involvement. Why can't he, and others of his sex, fricking reach out and honestly talk about his pain? Why do most other boys spit in his face because he's miserable? Why do many grown-up males give the kind of advice to suffering males designed to create abusers, bullies and serial killers, even now? Like, \"Man up\" \"Suck it up\" \"What are you, a girl (creating a future wife-beater, thanks ever so much...)\" \"Crybaby (do we not all have tear ducts?)\"  I'M SCrEaMinG NOW!Teen girls should read this so they can identify some of the ways some males behave, which is beyond rationality and destructive. Girls,  YOU CAN'T FIX THEM.  For many men, they maintain a case of meanness and grudge forever for everyone they meet in life because they never come out of it or learn communication or examine their internal pain. Holden's agonies and his attempt at burying the pain as deeply down as he can ring absolutely true about many males. The lack of support he receives from many also rings true. In this kind of trouble, generally speaking, a boy needs a man's help. But it has to be a man who has examined his own life, and can talk about it. A grown-up mentor needs to be a regular guy-type, plays basketball or something, goes fishing, stuff like that, too. Stereotypical and absolutely true. I'm serious. It's like that. Sigh. I recognize some guys also knit and grow flowers and like to dress up, but many young boys are scared by individuality - it's part of their young boy pack mentality stage to kill the different.In the 1950s, especially, American society was very repressed and bent by the emotional suppression of negativity and bodily functions or dirt (I mean real earth dirt and dust) or any recognition of death, dying, or child/female abuse, old clothes, and nonconformity of any kind which strayed from a twin-bed married life. The majority of American people were carrying Holden's confusions within themselves. Any wild or real expressions of emotion were socially condemned unless released in controlled and restrained manners. Drinking a fifth every night was ok, though.I  HATED the 1950's in good ol' USA.",

Probably he was alluding to my slight aversion to YA. But I decided to heed his advice, but turns out it was not needed. TCITR (as I will be referring to this book from here onwards) is not like any YA found on the bookshelves of today, which though not necessarily ‘bad’ aren’t really to my taste. But this one certainly sets the bar quite high. The story begins with Holden Caulfield, our brash and narcissistic narrator, recounting the events of three days of his life starting with the day he decides to ‘leave’ school. Well, he decides to leave earlier than intended considering the school kicked him out. I should also mention that this was not the first school that he was kicked out of. But that wouldn’t faze our fearless teen angst ridden quixotic Caulfield. He perceives the institutions and its occupants ‘phony’ disguising their selfish endeavors and with gentility. I won’t reveal  of the story but suffice it to say that the story pretty much follows Holden after his escape from the ‘graveyard of phonies’ to New York. There’s drinking, bars, cigarettes, sex and wild abandon. And right there in the hotchpotch, Salinger addresses so many issues and not in the manner of waving the flag right in your face but with so much delicacy, it permeates all the  deeply for it. What  could you want! What struck me throughout the story is the excess use of the word ‘phony’ that is used to describe everything that the child in Holden despises. In fact I believe the child within was the narrator that was in constant loggerheads with the inevitability of the future that ushered adulthood. Adulthood represented artificiality, a joyless, dark and gloomy world. And even so, a constant gloom seemed to be in the very backbone of the story. Which makes sense now that I know the story was supposed to been written from a mental hospital. Another thing( in a long long list) that struck me was how brash and cocky H sounded even though through his own voice it was so clear that he suffered from insecurity issues and felt alienated from a world that didn’t quite ‘get’ him. His constant criticisms served as a reflection of his own inadequacies. I found the book like looking into the mind of an adolescent boy without any filter, hence it very beautifully brings forth the deficiencies of mental faculties, not yet refined thoughts and the delicate lack of empathy so true at that age. The tone in the book was monopolized and while to some it may seem quite repetitive, was for me the best tool in the story. It was unadulterated and an excellent coming of age thing. And oh yeah, the book was depressing. How lovely! P.S.: If I wasn’t clear enough already- J.D.Salinger is a genius. Thank you!",

However, I did not feel like reviewing a half-read book, so I decided to get through with it. There wasn’t much of a story, to begin with, so I won’t be getting into the synopsis. Alienation and issues of identity are the central themes for the story. To give an overview, it followed the journey of Holden Caulfield. Having expelled from the school, Pencey, failing out of three others before it he was afraid of confronting his parents and did not schedule to return home until the beginning of the Christmas holidays. He stayed at the Edmont hotel and spent his entire money on drinks while he roamed the streets of New York. He hired a prostitute at the hotel who tricked him into paying  than what he was supposed to pay. Having decided to hitchhike his way to the west, he wanted to see her sister, Phoebe for the last time. He sent her a note asking her to come to see him at a museum on her way home. Phoebe determined to leave with her brother, brought a suitcase with her. Eventually, Caulfield confirmed to her that he would go back home. Moreover, that’s that!The only thing I liked about this book was Holden’s relationship with his sister and the good influence she had on him.The story narrated in a subjective style followed Caulfield’s exact thought process. To him, everything that happened was either ‘phony' or ‘depressing'. Also, that’s exactly how I was feeling. I thought Holden himself was a tad bit of a phony himself, and I both detested him and related to and agreed with him simultaneously. For me, this book was a complete waste of time.I found that the writing style was repetitive and ponderous. Many simple sentences were written twice, which questioned a reader’s ability to understand the text. Phrases like ‘and all' and ‘or something' made it even lousier. I neither cared for the story nor the characters.The Catcher In The Rye is a very beloved classic, and it depends entirely on the reader how they like it. As for me, it was an utter bore. “I don’t exactly know what I mean by that, but I mean it.” ",

If you do, you start missing everybody.\"Phew...I don't seem to have any grudges for Holden, in fact, I feel bad for him. I can understand all that teenage angst and how it feels like to be around phony people; makes me remember my own 16-years-old self and how it would have loved reading this book back then, would have been glad to have a best friend like Holden. ( Also, the usage of word \"phony\" made me goddamn annoyed, just like that. )To be honest, I don't really know how I feel about this book. I didn't get the message or the purpose it's trying to convey, the whole era, NYC back then, it made it hard for me to relate with certain things despite finding similarities with Holden.I have seen everyone talking so much about Holden but barely speaking anything about Phoebe. I mean every character named Phoebe is just so sweet.I literally adored that smart little child, she's just so kind, and not only as a supportive sister to her brother but as a person in whole. I think we need to learn those bits from her, it makes her a beautiful human being.I don't actually like reading depressing books, but if you do, you can read this classic!

Let's do this.The story is about the controversial Holden Caufield, and all the angst and teenage alienation that he felt in the world. I've read the book way, way back and never really gotten into writing a review until now. I submitted papers to school, of course, but I've stolen those from the internet.Now. Holden Caufield. I've read a lot about the fictional guy. In between and out of the Catcher in the Rye pages. People either see him as a hero (mostly teenagers) or see him as a whining bitch (mostly grow-ups), which in my opinion is what makes the book a classic. When, after decades, your story can still get a rise out of people and has the ability to start a heated parent-child argument... you're immortalized in the literary world.Well,I'm nothing if not argumentative. But truth is, I've never gotten into any argument about this book. Yet. The thing is I don't hate Caufield. And I also don't idolize him. What I feel toward the sarcastic, undecided, lonely guy is pity. While reading the book, I feel so sorry for him I almost cried. He is just a kid and he just needs attention. He still grieves about his brother's death. He doesn't know what to do with himself nor with his life. He might or might not like this girl but he can't even make himself ring her up. It's not like I don't ever see myself in him. I do too. I was a teen once and I'm also that undecided. I also depress about everything. I also thought my problems and issues must be and should be the greatest, most important thing happening in the universe. But I'm 21 now so i'm all wise and you know, mature-not. Just a little different really. Because we all change, which is by the way brings me to sharing these lines that just about killed me. \"You'd just be different, that's all. You'd have an overcoat this time. Or the kid that was your partner in line the last time had got scarlet fever and you'd have a new partner. Or you'd have a substitute taking the class, instead of Miss Aigletinger. Or you'd heard your mother and father having a terrific fight in the bathroom. Or you'd just passed by one of those puddles in the street with gasoline rainbows in them.\"When I first read the book I also waited for something big to happen in the story, some crazy twist, some clear, well-defined plot line. Salinger would have none of it. All throughout it's just Caufield telling us about himself, confusing contradictions, self-inflected problems, baseball glove, and red hunting hat. At first, this is a let-down for me. But then I just had an epiphany. (See what I did there? Throwing big words when I'm not sure what else to say.) I realized that this is the genius of this book. It's about nothing particular, just life, which could be something or everything. Or yeah, nothing at all.When I think about it, really think about it, the message of this book for me is: It's okay. Be confused. Be misunderstood. Be sad. Make mistakes. Screw up your life. You'll change. Maybe learn. What's black and white is that you'll change. You'll get over yourself. What I wish is, what we very uncertain and young and stupid people wish is, we could play and run in the open field, and never fear of falling through, and knowing that somebody would be there for us- to be our Catcher in the Rye.Now forgive this review if it doesn't make Any sense at all.

So when I finally got around to reading it as a 36 year old mother of 4, I was thrilled to be finding out what all the fuss is about. All I can say is, thank God I've read it for the first time at an age where I can articulate my emotions, because if I had read it in high school, I'm pretty sure the entire world would have be reduced to pink mist at the frustrated and disgruntled hands of my AK-47.It slices me in half that this drivel is so lauded when there are kindergarten kids writing perfectly good sentences about whales and bananas which never make it out of the classroom, much less onto a 100-books-to-read-before-you-die list. There were a couple of astute observations, and there are several passages that are quite amusing, but the problem is that by the time you get to them, you are so atrophied with boredom that your body no longer remembers how to laugh and can only emit a slow, pained whine instead. Or maybe that was just Holden, moaning again?There is absolutely nothing this character does not complain about. I'm pretty sure that if a clown tried to give him a balloon filled with 40 million dollars, Holden would call him a phoney and tell him to fuck off. Are we supposed to be surprised that he's actually a virgin? Of course he is. Imagine him having sex with someone - \"My orgasm was pretty crummy. How was yours goddammit. Wait...you didn't have one? ARE YOU A PHONEY? Boy, that kills me, if you want to know the truth. I mean. Boy.\"No wonder JD Salinger became a recluse after this became so successful. I'd be embarrassed too.",

But the reason I repeated reading it, is nothing to with the American this and that.I suppose there are many people who may regard this book as pulp or a passtime magazine. I prefer to leave them be. Holden Caulfield is about how every one of us is disgustingly fake and how each and every one of us continues to pretend we aren't so. The only way out is to embrace that fake-ness. It's not as bad as it sounds you know.I used to read the ending just to remind myself what was going on in the whole book. Holden's sister IS the catcher. She is the whole point in life. At least for Holden. Everyone has some catcher. Or else, I don't know what.I also like the bit on the prostitute. I do not know why, she gave me a tense realization of Holden's inner conflict. She gave me possibilities of every character of the book. It is also the texture of the book. It is a book of possibilities. You never really know any character for sure. Except for the sister whose name I forgot. She is the only divine figure in this godless, wanna-be-tragedy. I'd very much like to dig into the concept of godlessness and the modern in \"Catcher in the Rye\" but that's a plan for the future for now.This book must be read to love or hate, not to like or dislike or say \"hmm, I guess it's just a book\".

There's no in between.I set my expectations high for this. I've been carrying this book with me and THRICE I have been told that it is good. Sadly, I'm one of the people who didn't think so.Honestly, there were a lot of things I didn't like about this book.1. Holden Caulfield. He is annoying and I know I am not alone in this. I admit that sometimes he is funny but he just keeps going on about how something \"depresses him\" or \"kills him\". To me, the whole book felt like a rant. Maybe that's the point and I've missed it but don't you eventually get tired of reading it?2. The Plot. Is there even a plot? I feel like an unwilling friend that Holden dragged along with him in his journey. Almost like when a friend tells you about something that happened to him and you have to sit there and listen because he's your friend. That's exactly what I felt. Even when I finished the book, the point is still unclear to me. The only thing I got from this book were the words of wisdom from Mr. Antolini.3. The writing. Maybe some people think this book is easy to read because of the writing style but it did the opposite for me. There's just too many repetitive phrases and it frustrated me so much.4. Page 92. Very specific, I know. But here's the part that kind of pissed me off.\"The thing is, most of the time when you're coming pretty close to doing it with a girl--a girl that isn't a prostitute or anything, I mean--she keeps telling you to stop. The trouble with me is, I stop. Most guys don't. I can't help it. You never know whether they really want you to stop, or whether they're just scared as hell, or whether they're just telling you to stop so that if you do go through with it, the blame'll be on you, not them. Anyway, I keep stopping. The trouble is, I get to feeling sorry for them. I mean most girls are so dumb and all. After you neck them for a while, you can really watch them losing their brains. You take a girl when she really gets passionate, she just hasn't any brains.\"I don't want to sound petty but I can't ignore Holden's prejudice either.I thought hard on whether I should review this one or skip it. I've read that this book has changed lives so some might feel passionately about it.  It is a classic book which kind of made me question myself for not liking it. But you can't please everyone and you can't like every single book you read.I believe this book is for people who identify with Holden and I'm one of those who didn't. Maybe it's less about the book but  on the person reading it.To look at this from a different perspective, I love this answer from a Goodreads user on why this book is considered a classic.In the end, it all goes down to how you view this book. It is clearly not for everyone and something that's not read for the sole purpose of enjoyment (which was my mistake).Review can also be found in my blog.",

See the link at the end.)Sometimes, I wonder if we’ve already fallen off the cliff. Holden Caulfield was supposed to catch us long ago; we were never supposed to choose life, washing machines, junk food, and mindless game shows--and yet we did anyway. We were supposed to die glorious deaths and live on forever way before we ever fell off the cliff. Yet here we are: we’re falling, and our falling is so quiet and mundane that by the time we’re about to hit bottom we’ve forgotten that there was a time we used to run around free in rye fields. You have no idea what I’m talking about, do you? I suppose I’m talking about Salinger’s Catcher in the Rye, and what the main character, Holden Caulfield, wanted to do when he grew up. He wanted to work in a rye field and catch kids right before they ran off the cliff into an untimely oblivion. It’s that moment in the novel that gives the book its title. I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of hay and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody’s around--nobody big, I mean--except me. And I’m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff--I mean if they’re running and they don’t look where they’re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That’s all I’d do all day. I’d just be the catcher in the rye and all.Of course, falling off the cliff symbolizes other things: becoming an adult, becoming a phony, trying to own a Cadillac. It means all the hazards of becoming an adult. It symbolizes the spiritual death of children. Or it could symbolize other things. You’re sophisticated adult readers—you can make up your own mind about what the cliff is about. But I’ve already become convinced that both J.D. Salinger and Irvine Welsh (we’ll get to his book Trainspotting) were writing about the same thing: a middle class society that makes us into things we don’t want to be. We start off as playful kids and we become, well, awful. This essay is a long conversation I started with myself back in high school. At that time, I had it all figured out because the assignment was to have it all figured out. I was also 17, which explains a lot. You can read the rest of the review right here: ",

I swear, books like these are always best when you read them willingly. When you read them as a  mature, better read person. Holden is one of those unique characters that can never be re-written, but seems to get better when re-read. He is so full of rage and anger and hatred... He has this awesomely genuine DISLIKE of everything. And yet, even though he is miserable and unhappy and trudging through his days and nights with a scowl on his face, he takes the time to tell us what its like to hold hands with a special girl, how their hands were made to hold each other's, and you get to see that there this highly guarded tenderness to him as well.I am really glad that I decided to pick this back up again. I definitely recommend it to anyone who was forced to read it for school, because, like me, you were most likely not prepared for what Salinger and Holden had to tell you. ",

(Jerome David) Salinger’s classic. The Catcher in the Rye remains controversial even today, I can’t imagine the uproar it surely caused in 1951. The novel centers around 16 year-old Holden Caufield, narcissistic to the core, which makes him a very unlikable guy. Yet, from the opening sentence, I felt drawn in to his unique, wholly Holden view. Like a bad train wreck, it's impossible to look away. Or in this case, I couldn’t stop reading. Coupled with his constant criticisms and overtly excessive profanity, I couldn’t help but earnestly question his sanity.Fairly early on, I got the sense that (view spoiler)[something had to give, or else he’d likely snap and do something he’d later regret. Take, for instance, the questionable chain of events between Stradlater and Holden’s beloved childhood friend, Jane Gallagher. When he returned from their impromptu “date,” Stradlater’s shady behavior inevitably led me to suspect that something terrible had gone awry… As a result, I thought that Holden would find out what had transpired, and that he’d threaten his life, at the very least. (hide spoiler)] And I might have dismissed my suspicions, if not for the fact that throughout the novel, Holden often reminds himself to touch bases with Jane, only that never happens. There’s always a convenient excuse at hand, which Holden seems all too willing to oblige.There are many moments of irony here… But Salinger’s story isn’t really about what may or may not have happened between his so-called “friend” and Jane Gallagher. The beautiful relationship between Holden and his kid sister, Phoebe, is much  relevant. I love the special bond they share, it’s one that’s been carefully nurtured over many years.It’s a nice change to know that he actually cares about someone other than himself. At the same time, it develops his character even further and we get a sense of Phoebe.Phoebe is the only person he’s ever allowed himself to love.. it’s sad, but incredibly touching at the same time.. Salinger also gives us profound insight into Holden’s older brother, which adds additional depth to his character. It speaks volumes about why he is the way he is, IMO. Prior to about the halfway point, I still felt very little for our protagonist, but with the incorporation of various insights and/or developments, something totally unexpected happened: I actually started to feel something for him, on a very personal level. More than that, at was as if Holden and I had formed a connection. He feels akin to me, and I’d like to think the feeling’s mutual, for I have also dealt with depression for most of my life. The thought of harming myself in one way or another has played a major role throughout my adult life. I’m deeply ashamed to admit that so publicly, but I won’t deny it..Courtesy of Robert Burns‘ 1782 poem, Comin’ Thro’ the RyeO, Jenny’s a’ weet,[A] poor body,Jenny’s seldom dry:She draigl’t[B] a’ her petticoatie,Comin thro’ the rye!Chorus:Comin thro’ the rye, poor body,Comin thro’ the rye,She draigl’t a’ her petticoatie,Comin thro’ the rye!Gin[C] a body meet a bodyComin thro’ the rye,Gin a body kiss a body,Need a body cry?[D](chorus)Gin a body meet a bodyComin thro’ the glenGin a body kiss a body,Need the warl’[E] ken?[F](chorus)Gin a body meet a bodyComin thro’ the grain;Gin a body kiss a body,The thing’s a body’s ain.[G](chorus)Ilka lassie has her laddie,Nane, they say, ha’e IYet all the lads they smile on me,When comin’ thro’ the rye. In closing, I envision Holden as a mature and stable adult (now an aging 76 years of age,) being in charge of those children we’ve neglected, or left behind. I believe he excelled at it, too. Perhaps he was even given praise, every now and again. But even if that isn’t the case, the joy and pride he feels upon a job well done is compensation enough. \"It's 'If a body meet a body coming through the rye!\"",

He does so using the language available to him, one of a teenager's own, with all that that implies (insults, repetitions, references to the sexual acts and transparency). In his ideas and conceptions about the people he interacts with and the places he transits to, is hiding a strong social critique that is worth discussing as a reader.I believe that the author managed to write with solidity from the voice of a teenager and capture the extremism, spontaneity and emotional lability that many of us have probably experienced as we went through that stage of our lives.I found many mixed reviews of this book but personally I enjoyed reading it so much and kept wondering why I hadn’t picked it up earlier.",

Salinger, whose career was not very prolific and his novel has since become a book on 99.99% of high school curriculums that just about everyone reads. This is what I see as being \"a novel about nothing.\" However, the idea that Seinfeld follows the life and times of Jerry Seinfeld and his gang and The Catcher in the Rye follows Holden Caulfield brings about the postmodern argument that there really is nothing special about any given life and that in the life of the common man, others will simply see it as nothing. In the case of a teenager, who in many cases life is all about them, the postmodern argument displays otherwise. This novel was written right at the peak of postmodernism, too.Let's talk about Holden Caulfield. I saw him as being a clear misfit and a bad influence. He smoked, drank underage, lied to get his way, got into fights, failed in all except one of his classes, and was just plain rude to just about everyone he came across. He is telling the story and he does not really defend his actions, which I feel cannot be defended. The one thing that really stuck out to me, though, was his love for his siblings. He had a clear sense of affection for his deceased younger brother, Allie, and his living and feisty younger sister, Phoebe. His older brother, D.B., was a Hollywood screenwriter, whom he liked, but tended to find a bit over the top. His interactions and moments where he was with Phoebe are clearly the best parts of the novel. Holden engages in plenty of adventures that are scattered across the novel without a driving plot. He meets teachers at their homes, engages in banters with his roommates, dances with women about ten years older, meets with nuns, and comes into contact with a prostitute... and it really amounts to nothing.While The Catcher in the Rye can definitely be relatable to teens and strikes chords where it is designated to do so, I cannot say that this was an enjoyable novel and that Holden Caulfield was an enjoyable character. Then again, I am 24 and would never engage in most of the things Holden did. The two of us have nothing in common, but still, I could not see where Holden would be likable. He has traits that people can relate to, but they are clearly not for me. The most I could recommend The Catcher in the Rye for is a light rent or a cheap buy. I do not find this to be a full price buy nor do I feel that teachers should be held to the standard of assigning this novel. I would much rather prefer that Robert Cormier's novels, specifically I Am The Cheese if we want something with a similar tone to this novel, be assigned instead. Cormier's novels are much  honest AND straightforward than The Catcher in the Rye and I feel that this is what should be displayed in what is assigned in high school. This looks much  like a random selection.It can also be assured that Mark David Chapman is just a renowned cuckoo. Why this novel would inspire him to kill John Lennon is beyond my wildest beliefs...You can find the discussion I had about this book on Literary Gladiators here: ",

Actually, I was very reluctant towards this book till once I read a few pages in library and I was totally taken by the passive language used in it. (That's what makes this book a figure of contraversy in literature) The protagonist actually felt so close - as an introvert bibliophile young adult one is passing thro' similar problems (but usually not at that extent as in the book) with changes in secretion of harmones at this age. The book describes the journey of a 17 - years old boy (Holden Caulfield) towards alienation which is actually an act of self-protection with the cynical sense of superiority, this isolation is some stabilization in a messed up life according to Caulfield but is actually the source of all his problems. He actually fears the change and it's complexity which leads him to a fantasy of adult world as superficial and hypocritical. He even fantasizes himself as 'The Cather in the Rye' (the protector of children from falling into adulthood) which looks like a Heroic act. The entire book and espicially the climax is structured magnificiently. The elements, symbols and motifs are skillfully used in texts and are so touching. A remarkable transition is described at the end not to be spoiled. ",

There are rare occasions that he does show sincerity or kindness, but not often enough. His mood swings and actions were, to me, very annoying and not like any teenager I know, despite readers saying this is relate-able. I struggled to read this, not because it was boring but because of Holden's personality and the way he talks. The ending was also a let down because I thought that there would be a better ending.

        "This book gets a lot of flak because its protagonist, Holden Caulfield, is crude and random in his thought patterns. But that's only a superficial view.

He has PTSD, particularly as a result of the death of his brother Allie and another boy at one of his former schools, James Castle. As his mentor tells him, Holden is \"confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior\" (246), and this is the reason for his \"bad\" attitude and disruptive behavior. The phoniness of the world makes him sick, literally so, and reviewing his troubled memories is part of his personal healing. In fact, far from being \"immoral,\" Holden is probably the only MORAL person of the book (aside from his little sister Phoebe). He is the only one who recognizes how false and pretentious people can be, and is also the only one who calls the world out for it. I get that the content of this book may not be appropriate for younger audiences, and others may balk at the frequent cussing. But let's not make the mistake of thinking Holden is rotten — he's the only one in this book who has a soul.",

So yes, while I enjoyed the wittiness that came with seeing through Holden's eyes, I also quickly became tired of it. In the beginning, his humorous comments were fantastic. But after two hundred pages of the same joke told over and over, just in different context? Um. No thank you. That gets old.Another thing. Holden was really whiny, and quite stupid (now I sound mean). Now, now, don't get all upset with me. I do realize this book is \"symbolizing\" adolescence (or something like that), but I never acted this dull at sixteen. Really. His dumb choices were annoying me. Though, again, I realize how without his choices, there would be no book. All in all, I liked him and I hated him.I don't want it to seem like this book was all bad - since it wasn't - I did enjoy how Holden felt everything but learned to hide it because he knew society didn't really care how he felt. I think we can all relate to that feeling. Overall, it's good that I finally got around to reading this! It was a long time coming.

For most After being sucked into Holden's stream of consciousness for the last two days and just now coming up for air, I suppose there are two or three things I'd like to mention.The goddamn ducks, obviously. The cab driver had it all wrong, and all Holden wanted was a straightforward answer. The mallards that fleck the North American landscape are sensitive to changes in the food supply and model their migratory patterns accordingly, not unlike Homo sapiens prior to the advent of agriculture. For most of their history, humans have hunted and gathered where there was food to hunt and gather, schlepping off to new haunts as the seasons and weather dictated. It's not that ducks don't have the ability to withstand the wintry conditions. Indeed, their thick feather coats serve as nature's perfect insulators. Rather, they follow the food. During the northeast winter, insects, fish and aquatic plants like duckweed become scarce as cold temperatures transform the local ecology.Annual changes in duck concentrations can also provide clues as to the cold conditions from which they flew. A harsher winter will bring  birds south to the Mississippi River Valley, for example, to feed on plants and grass not covered by snow and in open waters not glazed over with ice. Due to the weakening of the polar jet stream brought about by changes in the global climate, we've been seeing  ducks nestled along the southern locales of North America in recent years.That was all probably  than you wanted to know, but if someone had explained this to Holden in grade school it would have been one less thing bouncing around his busily eccentric mind.Troubled YouthWhich brings us to Holden Caulfield himself and the man who created him. What strikes me about this novel is the nagging question of whether we are glimpsing inside the mind of Salinger or whether Holden is a cold-cloth fabrication. I suppose anything a person writes is a glimpse into their mind in a way, but we are always left to wonder how closely a book's characters resemble their creator. Is Holden's brooding disaffectedness a reflection of a lifelong angst and alienation suffered by Salinger?Salinger was of course the quintessential enigmatic recluse, but that hasn't stopped commentators from speculating. We know he was born and raised in New York City, that he performed poorly in school—so much so that his father sent him to military academy in Pennsylvania as a last resort—and that he later joined the Army during World War II. Like so many others, the war seems to have had a profound and lasting influence on Salinger, who was hospitalized for nearly a year in Nuremberg. The unauthorized biographer Ian Hamilton suggests Salinger suffered a nervous breakdown in July 1945, which may explain Salinger's letter to friend Ernest Hemingway in which he mentioned almost being discharged from the Army on psychiatric grounds.Autobiographical or not, Salinger's Caulfield is among those rarefied characters who have managed to compel readers for generations. Even those who don't necessarily connect with Holden tend to find his angst-ridden mirror on society irresistible. I don't see much of myself in his chronic repining over things big and small, and still I was drawn to him, like a car crash from which you can't quite look away. The \"plot\", if we can call it that, hardly extends beyond the inner recesses of Holden's mind. Indeed, his vortex of dread and relentlessly wry running commentary is the plot. He's the directionless teenager we all love to hate, and I think it's because wrapped up in Holden's embittered, existentialist essence is a version of our past or present selves we can't help but identify with.I sincerely wanted Holden to course-correct and not let his overpowering discontent get the better of him. Maybe he would have been better off with a healthy dose of SSRIs and some counseling, or perhaps—given the subversionary role reversal in which he and his sister Phoebe are engaged in the closing section—he just needed to see himself from the outside looking in. The Streisand EffectI dug around a bit trying to find out why I didn't read this book in high school like everyone else. As it turns out, The Catcher in the Rye is one of the most censored books in U.S. history, which would certainly explain its absence on the reading list at the ultraconservative Christian school I attended. Apparently Holden's rebellious nature was (and still is) thought to be too infectious, his vocabulary too potty-mouthed and the sexual references too saucy. Atheism also pops up sparingly, with Holden self-identifying as an atheist and attributing the label to his brothers as well. Alas, it's safe to assume this numbered among the reasons many a school board fought for its proscription.Of course, the Streisand effect all but guarantees that banning a work of art will only lift its status far higher than it may otherwise have achieved. In any case, Salinger's best-known work is no worse for the wear, and excels in its own right. The frosty Holden is as captivating as he is cynical, and his penchant for slang and low-brow humor make for easy reading. It might have taken me longer than most to read this literary classic, but it was well worth the wait.Note: This review is republished from my official website.",

After being told that he will be expelled because of his lack of work at his private school, Holden goes to New York City so that he can have some time to break it to his parents he has been booted from another school.Holden is lazy and critical of everyone around him. Heck there were several profound comments that he made about pimply guys and ugly girls that just made him sound like such an awesome person to be around, one wonders why he has no close friends.I think that J.D. Salinger was definitely going for something here I think to speak about how so many teens feel alienated from the world and people around them. But I didn't get the sense that Holden was alienated, just bored with everyone because he held everyone except for his sister, and his two brothers in total disdain. The writing was not great. It was repetitive to the point that I was able to totally call what Holden was going to say. I never want to hear the words \"They really can\" ever again.That's the thing about girls.Every time they do something pretty, even if they're not much to look at, or even if they're sort of stupid, you fall in love with them, and then you never know where the hell you are.Girls.Jesus Christ.They can drive you crazy.They really canYou poor thing. Falling in love with a girl that is not attractive and dumb. And yet they still don't want you. Almost every time somebody gives me a present, it ends up making me sad.So profound. I mean I hardly rolled my eyes that hard after I read this. The flow was also pretty awful. I think it was because the story just went on and on and on to the point I was rooting for a bad end for Holden. Can you tell that I couldn't stand this character?The setting of New York honestly didn't feel real at all. Maybe because Holden was so far up his own butt, the only thing that gets described are other people (specifically girls/women) and how attractive they are or in the case of this book, how ugly he finds them. The ending I think was supposed to make me think. It just once again made me roll my eyes hard. What can one say about a character that I don't think matures at all, and still sees the problems with everyone and not himself. ",

Its so obvious that what Holden suggests is true - that life happens in the digression. Its in the spaces between what is direct and indirect, it engagement in the moment and your reflection on it. Heartbreaking moment in the story (so many of them) is when the record he so lovingly bought for his sister breaks. Phoebe is an amazing character, and its equally poignant when she shows up with a suitcase at the museum and demands to go away with him, and that is the thing that shows him he can no longer run. Unquestionably, for all of the angst, Holden Caulfield is authentic, and Holden Caulfield is loved. Its an amazing speech near the end that his former English teacher gives - about figuring out what you love and going for it. Its kind of like the record, the hunting hat, and other experiences he creates out of nothing. You have to figure out what matters, what is worth a possible shattering of the heart, and then go for it with everything you've got. What a shame that these books are wasted on the young. I hope my fifteen year old has the opportunity to read it again someday too. And to take it in. This one stands the test of time.",

I found this similar to another favorite novel of mine, Phillip Roth's 'Indignation' - both feature a teenage misfit who, in failing to assimilate at his expensive, predominantly white prep school, embarks on a path of self destruction. I can relate. My own life has been a procession of cyclical misadventures. I am sympathetic to Holden because he is dysfunctionally functioning - mostly by just being kind. He'll loan you his turtleneck even if he barely knows you, and he'll drop $10 in the nun's basket without being asked, and he'll watch over old Phoebe because he loves his little sister.

I look forward to the day when I see it flapping against a lamp post, in a cold, wet Lexington Avenue wind.\"I've never felt this lonely reading a book before.Probably because the overall theme of the book is quite depressing; the protagonist, Holden Caulfield, being a lonely, miserable sixteen-year-old who gets kicked out of school (again) and takes to the streets of New York for three days, as his parents aren't expecting him to come home yet.It seems Holden is often regarded as a character that embodies what it's like to be a teenager. I can't say I agree with that at all. Sure, he's 'rebellious' - a word that I often hear being thrown around when people talk about teenage years - but for me being a teenager definitely hasn't felt like it did for Holden. Maybe that's just because Holden and I are polar opposites. I just couldn't relate to him at all. He's essentially everything I am not, personality-wise.I did find it slightly aggravating how Holden kept making comments on things relating to homosexuality. I understand that this book was published in 1951 and things were slightly different then, but I still don't think it's acceptable. Holden keeps picking fights, doesn't keep many opinions to himself, and is extremely hypocritical and negative, but I still found myself sympathising with him a few times. Especially because he constantly seeks human interaction but keeps being met with the raw distance that is stuck between him and the rest of the world, leaving him lonely and secluded after each conversation. Holden's thoughts are laid bare on each page; nothing is held back. He tells everything he feels and sees - everything that is true to him. Even things he himself doesn't completely understand.Salinger really did something with this one: Teachers were fired (and reinstated, luckily), copies of his book were removed from schools in the United States (The Catcher in the Rye ended up being one of the most censored books of the twentieth century), and John Lennon's assassin was found reading the book out loud to himself after the murder.That last piece of information fried at least a few of my brain cells.",

Also he has been expelled out of a school for fourth time in a row.The story revolves pretty much around Holden, his encounters with different people like his history teacher, his dormitory mates, mother of a guy who studies with him, a prostitute, his younger sister etc. After an uneventful night at dormitory he decides he’s had enough of this place and will go to Manhattan three days early, stay in a hotel, and not tell his parents that he is back. When he arrives at destination, he goes into a phone booth and considers calling several people, but for various reasons he decides against it. Finally he hires a cab and checks in at some lousy hotel. He spends time drinking at a bar, having unwanted events unfolding around him and finally go to sleep. Next day he calls up a girl he used to date, Sally, and convince her to go on a date with him, but the date goes wrong and he ends up offending her big time.Then he meets his old student adviser, who is now a student at University. He then decides to sneak into his own apartment building and wake his sister, Phoebe. He is forced to admit to Phoebe that he was kicked out of school, which makes her mad at him. He tells her his fantasy of being “the catcher in the rye,” a person who catches little children as they are about to fall off of a cliff. Holden ends his narrative here, telling the reader that he is not going to tell the story of how he went home and got “sick.” The Catcher is the Rye is undoubtedly a classic masterpiece by Salinger. If you observe the writing style then you would notice that he has written the book with such coolness and edginess that it makes you wonder how can an author think ahead of his time. The book is really simple but the deeper meaning it has within, is awakening, almost heart-touching. One should definitely read this book once in a lifetime!",

He tells of his roommates and teachers and his older brother RB, a big writer in Hollywood; Phoebe, his adored younger sister and Allie, his younger brother who died. Holden has a number of desultory encounters through the course of the several days; with roommates, a teacher who probably wants to molest him, some out of town girls in a bar and most poignantly with Phoebe as he sneaks into his family home, anxious to avoid his parents for as long as possible once they learn of his latest expulsion.I am about 40 years too old to get the maximum benefit from The Catcher in the Rye. To get the most out of it you probably have to have been a teenager in the fifties. Reading the book when you are old and full of life’s experiences, irrespective of how you have handled them, allows some detachment. We know how youthful anger, uncertainty, naïve hopefulness (witness the time when Holden wants to go away – anywhere, he just wants to go off somewhere with Sally - the idea quickly comes to nothing) and a  or less permanent state of directionlessness (I hope that is a word), and lack of fulfilment, can change over time. We know these feelings modify and dissipate over the years as hopes fade or a calling is found, skills are acquired and concrete obligations arise and have to be met. In short, we cope.Holden doesn’t cope. He does not apply himself. He is all over the place. He has been profoundly affected by the death of his younger brother. I was worried he was going to take his own life.I have to imagine how impactuous this book was in 1951. I know impactuous is not a word but Adele, one of my collaborators, used it when we were reviewing a film and when I said ‘I don’t think that’s a word, she replied, ‘Well, it should be!’ The Catcher in the Rye was impactuous then and still is now.",

He's the kind of fictional character I WANT TO MEET IN REAL LIFE AND TALK TO. He affects me A LOT. And that happens rarely to me. Yes, I like characters a lot. And I fangirl all the time but only few can pierce through me and affect me so much. Holden did that. He makes me sad. He really does. He makes me want to change my views. Yes, maybe he does have a VERY depressing view of the world and let's admit it, he does hate a lot of things but despite all of that, I still feel a lot of sympathy towards him.I wouldn't say anything any because I don't think my voice about this novel is not that important anyway. But I'll say this: The Catcher In The Rye DESERVES to be a classic. Maybe it won't work with EVERYONE but what's new with that? J.D. Salinger is a brilliant novelist and so is this book. He and Holden may not capture every readers heart but he have mine. Just from the very first chapter. I have to appreciate that. I don't think I'll ever forget this book. Ever. ",

In the novel, the main protagonist, Holden was kicked out from school and he ran away thinking that his parents would not understand him. He had this dream of \"catching children falling on cliffs\" (where the title came from) which was actually a metaphor since in the end it was his baby sister, Phoebe, who made him go back home (thereby saving his future).The only thing that prevented me from rating this with 5 stars is the language - the colloquial English, the cursing, etc. However, it is said to be the way teenagers spoke in the 50's in New York.

It's the struggle while awaking to the realities and the idealism they believe existed, during childhood. The ones who listen to others get through this without much of hassles but the few who cannot believe in norms, have tough phase finding out reality by themselves. Both these protagonist have this tough phase.The main character Holden, unable to get along with world, doesn't himself want to. He's dropped out of college, has fight with roomie and leaves safe place in dark night to get troubled  into open world. Since money is no big issue, he keeps stumbling from one experience into other. The character calls lying, conceited people phony n himself keeps lying unnecessarily. In tough situations, he still gets trapped in imagination of being shot with bullets, signifies his unwillingness to wake up. His conversation with Sally about eloping is fantasy shows running away from problems than stay put and fight. He adores his siblings, Allie and Phoebe. Their world is of innocence, simplified and something Holden knows well. He talks his mind to little Phoebe who understands the gist - that he's in problem and he should do something for that. When she asks 'name something you'd like to be', that shows she knows the answer to his problem. But Holden runs in fantasy again, being a one catcher in rye and saving kids from falling off. Saving comes easily to him coz he's suffering, and wants to help others. Like he helps the nuns, and the kids at museum, or repairing skating board for a tiny girl. Maybe coz he himself is in need but he can't receive it well when his teacher tries. In Mr Antolini's world - “you're riding for--it's a special kind of fall, a horrible kind. The man falling isn't permitted to feel or hear himself hit bottom. He just keeps falling and falling. The whole arrangement's designed for men who, at some time or other in their lives, were looking for something their own environment couldn't supply them with. Or they thought their own environment couldn't supply them with. So they gave up looking. They gave it up before they ever really even got started” some of them never get started while the few - they learn their lessons right have chances they shine bright in future. I wish there be Mr Antolini for each such student. Antolini is what he needed then - someone to love and looked up to, who also pays good ear to the confusion he's trapped in.Though this character is little shadowy- just so in Holden's mind. Since he cant believe his helper, he gets  unsettled.About relationships and sex, he has desires but lacks the courage to pursue them. He likes Jane but never calls her. He backs off in hotel though he himself calls a hooker. Throughout the book his interest in intimacy keeps popping. But like every other thing he's confused about it. It's all about the confusing adolescent. In various degrees everyone faces it; it's true individualism and due to simple prose n uncomplicated incidents it's easy to relate to it. No wonder books hits it off after so many years. A story, quite easy, evokes problems of even today's generation, openly. Wish they don't ban it so much.",

Salinger. The story takes place in mid 1950’s in New York City, where adolescent Holden Caulfield roams around searching for a place to fit in. When Holden learns that once again he has been kicked out of the prestigious private all boys school in which he is enrolled in for this month, he decides to leave the quiet school life and return home once again to New York City.Throughout this novel, I found many interesting aspects. The dialogue that Salinger wrote for Holden is truly capturing, and as a reader I begin to feel as though I grew up next door to the Caulfield’s my entire life. There is something about the way the main character goes about things, in such ways that no other person would be likely to think of. Holden is extremely dramatic, making it comedic and enrapturing for the reader. It was also interesting the amount of low self-esteem for which J.D Salinger provided for his main character. Holden is often depressed and this is clearly expressed at many points in the novel. Holden uses sarcasm, and although once again comedic, it makes it difficult for a reader to decide whether or not he is thinking. This point leads us into the next idea about J.D Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye, his weaknesses. As hilarious and awkward Holden Caulfield was throughout the novel, as a reader, a majority of my time in the novel I felt confused and unable to keep up with the main character. Continuously, I would find myself re-reading pages, and even chapters to attempt to understand what was going on in Holden’s life at that moment. Another weakness clearly expressed was the fact that there was hardly a plot. Yes, it may be naïve that I like a love story, and a happy ending, but this novel had neither. It did not have so much as a rise or fall of the protagonist. In fact, it was as though there was a rollercoaster of rises and falls for the protagonist, but none of them significant. This caused me to be bored with the novel, and once again have trouble getting through it without drifting off to other places in my mind.Although it may be true that a large portion of the United States thought that this novel was excellent and recommend it to all coming of age teens, I for one did not enjoy this novel; despite the comedy and intrigue. Even though this novel was not for me, I would recommend it to anyone whom enjoys male coming of age tales, for they would perhaps find it a better read than I have.",

For all intents and purposes this book was still about me, about what I was going through. I think that even now, in my 20's I'd find some of it relevant. Back then, though, it meant I found myself agreeing with Holden Caufield all the way through. His opinions and feelings and ways of reacting are very similar to my own, and perhaps that's why I loved it. Because I saw my own emotions and sentiments reflected in someone else. And that meant the world to me. I thought I'd been alone with a lot of my opinions and points of views, suddenly I found I wasn't (bear with me, back then this was still a very new experience I hadn't found in many books). It was great. That's not the only thing I like about it, sure it affected me on a personal level, but it also taught me a lot. And there are two things about it I hope I never forget, two things I believe are worth remembering.Firstly, the reason for the title (I love it, but I won't spoil anything).Secondly, his unconditional love for his sister. I love my own brother fiercely, so this is something I understand and feel strongly about.For me, these are the things that made the book stick in my memory and makes it timeless.",

It's been almost two years since I last read this book.Like so many of other readers, I initially HATED this book. There was seriously NOTHING I could identify myself with, and my Goodreads review back then goes like this:Quite honestly, I'm not even sure what to make of this - in the beginning, until I reached almost the half of the book, I was kind of mad at Holden because- I swear - there was NOTHING I could relate to him; I neither got to understood his feelings nor felt like trying to see things from his angle.Yet, when I was past 70 percent of the book, the closer it got to the end, the less disturbed and disgusted I became.Although I wouldn't go so far as to say I like this book, I wouldn't mind it as much as I did in the beginning.I may even go back to this book sometime later in my life, who knows I won't?I had thought that I would hate this book as much as I did the last time, but quite surprisingly, I actually enjoyed this reread.First and foremost, his narration didn't bother me as much; I clearly remember feeling frustrated and irritated by his insolent attitude as though he was making fun of everything, but with this reread, I was curious - the entire time - to know why he acts the way he does, I wanted to pin down where his sarcastic, sort of jaded perspectives come from.The narrator of this book and the protagonist, Holden Caulfield, basically lashes out at everything, literally EVERYTHING. Once he finds something that he doesn't like, he knocks it right off the bat and nothing escapes his cynical, sarcastic eyes.At the same time, however, he is sensitive and vulnerable; even the smallest of things can trigger his mood swings and his emotions and feelings fluctuate by the second. One moment he despises everything he sees, but the next minute something tugs his heartstrings and he becomes quite compassionate and appreciative.I think this second-by-second emotional fluctuation comes from his observant nature and is well reflected in somewhat desultory narration. We get to see how his mood swings and how depressed he gets through his soliloquy, but the author stops short of revealing Holden's true emotions and the reasons of his actions until we are well into the book. All I got to have up until that point was Holden's inexplicable, pent-up frustrations and angst the source of which I can't put my fingers on. Some of you may find this rather frustrating, but that actually worked well for me and made me power through this book.Like I said earlier, the writing reflects his vacillating emotions and his seemingly stuck-up nature really well. He has a very distinct voice and his perspectives may come across off-putting at first, but as I went deeper into the book, his compassionate, soft nature gradually came into view. I even find him far from apathetic or indifferent. Rather, I assume he is incredibly honest and doesn't want to do anything at a surface level; if he does do something, he wants to put his mind to it. That is where his aversion to phoniness comes from and it was masterfully narrated. Believe it or not, I was impressed by the writing. I was so invested in Holden's character this time.Although I still don't know where his angst and undirected emotions come from, I thought what he fears the most was 'change' or 'growth.'Whenever he observes others acting differently than before, he feels depressed and lonely. While he wants them to stay the way they used to be, they rapidly go through their transitional phase from childhood and adulthood.He doesn't want to grow up but he needs to grow up. Such ambivalent, conflicting emotions and the fear of failing to catch up with others torments him and drives him to his impulsive itinerant actions. I might be wrong, but that's how I viewed him.Again, there are so many things that I still can't put my finger on as to Holden's emotional process, but his desperate attempts to sate his emotional starvation was acutely felt this time. \"I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be. I know it's crazy.\"Sadly, however, it was up to this point I really enjoyed reading this book. This sequence, where Holden decides to go back to his house and sneak into Phoebe's room was a watershed moment for me both in a good way and a bad way. The dialogue that Holden has with Phoebe was pretty eye-opening and enlightening. Phoebe's character setting is just wonderful. She is smart as a tack for a 10-year-old, I personally found Phoebe much  mature than Holden. A simple sentence, just one single sentence she mentions here cuts right through the truth and takes Holden by surprise; triggered by her question, Holden starts to gush about the reason why he detests phoniness with his own words and this is where I felt that I partially understood Holden.I thought I would end up liking this book much better than the last time, but then again, there comes another twist and I was yanked back to the square one - another litany of rambling which I felt kind of sorry given the incident he went through but I felt my interest rapidly withering away. The ensuing 20 pages until the end felt pretty tedious and drag if you want to know the truth. The ending is kind of hopeful, it does end on a positive note. However, I still felt the ending a bit anticlimactic, or rather, it still leaves a lot of unanswered questions for me, it's almost akin to indigestion and I was kind of sad about not being able to say 'I loved it!' with this reread. Since I was enjoying this book until pretty close to the end, I really wish I could say that I come to love this book.That said, I am glad that I got to better appreciate this book than the last time. Apart from the ending, I really enjoyed reading this and I thought it is well-written and gripping.It definitely has a strong first half and only for that, I think I can raise my rating exponentially from 2 stars to 3.5 stars. If you go into this book knowing what kind of character Holden is in advance, you might not be put off by it as much. I put my much delightful reread down to having built up a stronger threshold for Holden. ",

After a fight with one of his roommates, he packs his bags and leaves.The school had kicked him out anyway because he flunked all of his classes besides English. He's got two days to kill till his parents expect him at home. What can a teenage, hormonal boy do but get drunk, attempt to flirt with older women, and, as Holden frequently puts it, horse around? May I be the millionth one to ask how in the world this ever became a classic? I suppose this is the gruesome birth of YA novels. It really surprised me how similar it was to how YA novels are written today. Imagine a John Green book, then put it together with The Perks of Being a Wallflower and this is the love child. I swear, it was like Stephan Chbosky read the book ten times and then wrote The Perks of Being a Wallflower. (although the writing style was actually much better in The Catcher in the Rye, if I'm honest) It was as if the author had gotten drunk, sat down, and wrote all night, and in the morning, The Catcher in the Rye was the result. Holden, besides being a compulsive liar, among other things, was a bit (understatement) mentally unstable. Everything depressed him and he thought about death all the time. He thought about how things would be if he died, how his family would react, the people who would show up at his funeral, etc. Then he'd turn around and say he didn't want to die or 'disappear'.Sometimes Holden would say something completely and utterly true as to how people think or what people do and act. Some of the things he thought were uncannily true/accurate observations of human nature. Then he'd say or think something that would be completely and utterly stupid and you'd think, what the hell, man? To Holden, everyone was either a phony, a moron, a whore, or just plain stupid. He was extremely judgmental. He judged people immediately on how they either looked or acted. But what people look like or even how they act is not necessarily a key to how they truly are. Maybe that's what the book was trying to say; how when you meet someone, you immediately make judgements about them. You can't help it, your mind does it almost automatically. That's what Holden represents, perhaps. I don't know. Maybe Holden was just kind of an asshole.Holden, to me, was an asshole, and at the same time, I kind of liked him. I pitied him. More or less. He was a depressed boy, and one who didn't know what to do with his life. Leaving school and being on his own for a few nights made him realize how depressing the world was when you looked at it. He felt like how a lot of teenagers do: that school is pointless and you feel invisible and just want to fit in. Everything's multiplied: Your hormones, your fatigue, your emotions, your judgements, etc. Small actions by others can set you off, either positively or negatively. The only thing I knew about this book before I went into it was that the main character's name was Holden. That's it. Now I know that it's about a boy named Holden who goes around smoking cigarettes, getting depressed, and being judgmental. Some parts of the book I really liked, and other parts irritated me, or were depressing. I have very mixed feelings about it. I really loved the second to last chapter, with Phoebe and Holden. What I didn't get was why Holden started getting angry with her all of the sudden when he got out of the museum. Why he felt such sudden hatred towards his little sister and even wanted to hit her. What the hell was that about?But my favorite scene came soon after that, when Phoebe put the hunting hat on Holden's head. It was so sweet. It's not a very pleasant book to read, I'll say that much. Holden is mentally and physically sick and his judgmental comments would be insulting to a lot of people. But then again, he's actually pretty funny sometimes. There were a couple nice sayings that were quoteworthy but it's still not much different a typical John Green novel nowadays. I'm guessing it was probably the inspiration for Green to write his books like he does. It's how the mainstream authors got started. It's one of those books that I liked and disliked at the same time. Very conflicting emotions. (view spoiler)[ I borrowed my copy from the library, and the book was written all over in the margins. But you know how Holden says 'goddamn' all the time? Well, someone had tried to cross out all the 'god' parts in 'goddamn'. Someone else erased the marks but you could still clearly tell what they had done. Lmao here. (hide spoiler)]",

This time reading it I annotated and made notes through-out, and so instead of trying to write the review that I have spent years trying to articulate (and which will be majorly biased anyway), I thought I'd just share the things I picked up on from my ninth reading of this novel. - Reference to David Copperfield at the start both links it to and separates it from classic bildungsroman tales- Holden plays a classic childlike game of catch outside an academic building, only to be told by a teacher to stop. A symbol of the swelling pressure of academia and adulthood on his life.- The Egyptians are so important for a number of different reasons. Firstly, Holden is fascinated by them because of their ability to preserve bones, translating to his need to preserve the youth and innocence of others. Holden then 'teaches' this to two young boys in a museum near the end of the novel, symbolically becoming the role of the teacher himself and thus closing up the circle of innocence-to-experience that he comes to terms with by the end. - Holden is an extremely unreliable narrator,  unreliable than I first ever noticed. Sometimes it's to 'hoarse' around but other times it's to save his reputation, like when he says he only threw up after drinking because he 'made' himself throw up. As well as this being an obvious lie, it disconnects him from those he sees abusing alcohol and convinces us (badly) that he is not one of them.- To have sex is to 'give someone the time', perhaps because it's a sign of growing older and maturity. Represents a moving forward of time.- Dancing is linked to Phoebe which is then linked to innocence. He likes girls who can dance because he likes the feeling of happiness he gets from dancing with his little sister. It is a sigh of youth and freedom.- Only one person in the whole book asks him if he's on his own, and he completely avoids her question and doesn't answer. - The way he talks about women is objectifying, infantilising and vaguely rapey.- References to the war link the trauma of war to the corruption of innocence, such as when Holden won't let Allie play with his BB guns because they are a symbol of violence. He constantly pretends he's been shot in a movie whenever he is hurt to deter from the realism of the war, and though he recognises how damaging this is, he continues to do it for his own protection.- So much is said about class, especially when talking about the guy who used his suitcases, and the visions he has of Sally drinking tea with the Lunts and the Ivy League boys. He hates it, although he is part of that culture himself.- Holden really doesn't like Romeo and Juliet because they did dumb shit when they tried to grow up too fast.- Harris Macklin is the opposite to Stradlater.- Holden takes Sally's hand when he wants to run away with her because he used to do that with Jane, and he's trying to reclaim those feelings- He sees no ducks in the park when he finally gets there because every other duck has flown away apart from him, leaving him in his own bubble of self denial and isolation.- There is a link between when James Castle commits suicide and when Holden contemplates suicide at the hotel. Holden is worried that nobody will cover up his body like Antolini did for James because he doesn't believe that the adults around him are capable of the good that Antolini is. - The 'fall' that Antolini talks about to Holden is the fall into adulthood.- Holden dreams of going into an isolated cabin to live his perfect life which is weirdly the exact same thing that Salinger did.- The mention of the 'psychoanalyst' at the end convinces me that Holden is in fact an a mental institution rather than being treated at a hospital for TB, which is what many speculate. He states that he 'practically' got TB, not that he actually got it, and we would be wise to distrust Holden when he uses such slippery language.",

Sometimes this world and this life is such a sad place to live in but if you know that there is someone willing to stay with you or be your friend, it doesn't seem so sad any.More Things I like about it:1. It was an easy read, even if it's a Classic book surprisingly it was very easy to read unlike Pride and Prejudice and The Great Gatsby (note: I didn't even finish these two books because my head exploded while I was reading them).2. It was very similar to The New Dress by Virginia Woolf and what a surprise they even have the same \"stream of consciousness\" style and the \"non-linear plot\" style. Mind you I love The New Dress but Catcher in the Rye was way better.3. Symbolism:-ducks= was actually Holden Caufield***When Holden Caufield was asking the cab driver what will happen to the ducks in the pond during Winter. What he was actually trying to say is that: \"What will happen to me during this winter?\"-red hunting hat= security blanket-when Holden says \"You\" in the narrative he actually means \"I\"One Thing I Don't Like About It1. The book was very \"Anti-Girl\" I just didn't like it that Holden says so many negative things about women and that he really generalizes women. Like for example he had an experience with this girl and he'll say something negative about it and then after that he will generalize it that \"All girls are like that\" and that was really way over the belt and that's just faulty generalization. I am a girl and all the negative things mention in this book about \"girls in general\" were highly ridiculous and so not true.Book Reviews by John Green, themissingn and 60 second recap ***I recommend you to watch these if you wanna understand Catcher in the Rye deeply***John Green: second recap This book made me want to kill John Lennon *kidding*",

It's a beautiful reciprocal arrangement. And it isn't education. It's history. It's poetry.”",

Which is to say, you English majors probably decided it was a classic and the rest of us bookworms decided to read it. And if Goodreads is anything to go by, a lot of people are glad they did. I didn't hate this book like I hated Flowers for Algernon. I think The Catcher in the Rye has some merit. I love the opening lines. It is one of the best hooks I have read in a long time. The book certainly presents a...unique hero. I don't care much for angst, though. I recognize that there were some moving, powerful scenes. I recognize that Holden is a very broken kid. I recognize that this book was well-written in how horribly written it is. It is planned out well.But I've got to be honest. I really didn't like any of it. I didn't like any of the characters. I found the plot random and stupid. The language grated on my nerves. It was so vulgar. All the females in this book are harpies or whores or idiots, except for Phoebe. And that makes me want to break something.  There was so much teenage angst. Oh, gosh. Holden is totally the black knight:   I totally feel like: This book was just very alien from my personality. I couldn't relate. I can empathize some, but not much. I don't like it. But I'm glad I read it. I'm going to go find something upbeat and happy now.Yours Momentary Devoid of Angst,Amy",

From the start I found Holden Caulfield’s voice funny and surprising, so drenched in period American slang that you can never forget when and where it’s set (e.g. “I have this grandmother that’s pretty lavish with her dough. She doesn’t have all her marbles any ”). He’s a typical lazy teenager who hasn’t been applying himself, so he’s flunking four subjects by the time he’s kicked out of Pencey Prep one December.The first part of the book is like a languorous farewell tour of his classmates and teachers before he takes the train back to New York City. Once he’s here, though, he doesn’t go straight home but instead lives it up in a hotel for a few days, reconnecting with old girlfriends and trying to get a prostitute to come to his room and a bartender to serve him alcohol even though he’s only sixteen. The only soft spot this tough guy has is for his siblings: Phoebe, his little sister, but also Allie, his younger brother who died of leukemia. The title, so bizarre but by now so culturally familiar, is adapted from a Robert Burns poem and speaks to Holden’s wish – no doubt inspired by what happened to Allie – to keep kids safe. This is one of those books where voice is so much  important than plot that it hardly matters what happens, but the end is still something of a shocker in that (view spoiler)[it appears Holden is writing this from a mental asylum after a breakdown (hide spoiler)].(When I read Gabe Habash’s novel Stephen Florida last year, I compared it to The Catcher in the Rye even though I hadn’t read the latter yet. The comparison definitely panned out; Habash’s novel about a North Dakota college wrestler has lines like “I guess I should describe myself. No, I don’t want to do that.” And it has a big cat on the cover. How about this passage from Catcher? “I felt like jumping off the washbowl and getting old Stradlater in a half-nelson. That’s a wrestling hold, in case you don’t know, where you get the other guy around the neck and choke him to death, if you feel like it. So I did it. I landed on him like a goddam panther.”)",

I never, ever want to hate a piece of literature, especially one that has had such a tremendous impact on the greater culture.However. I can't help it here. The Catcher in the Rye is one of the worst books I have ever picked up and read. And I can honestly say that I did genuinely read it, cover to cover. Its popularity and praise baffles me to no end, and the fact that so many angsty adolescents swear to identify with Holden is even  baffling. Holden whines for two-hundred pages about life, love, and his abhorrence for fake, conformist idiots. It blows my mind how three-quarters of the readers who claim to be Holden's kindred spirit are those exact idiots he just spent an entire twenty-six chapters detesting.The plot of the story...wait, what plot? The entire book is one giant, boring, continuous narrative that circles around endlessly in Caufield's head. Let's put it this way. If you were feeling particularly pretentious and moody one day, and you went on a walk to clear your head, the spiteful, mouthy ramblings of your conscience would be on par with what this book is essentially all about. To be blunt, Salinger; no one cares. If I wanted to read two-hundred pages of some over-priveleged youth complaining about anything and everything for no legitimate reason, I'd pick up my old high school diary. I have found that most of the people who truly enjoy this book aren't die-hard readers. Now, that may be a completely personal experience, and if it is, I do apologize. My best friend, who is just as much if not  of a bookworm than I am, does nothing but close her eyes and shake her head in disappointment at the mention of The Catcher in the Rye.Read this book at your own risk. Chances are, you will either fall completely in love with it or you will hate it with a fiery passion. I was of the latter, quite obviously. I simply did not, do not get it.",

I didn't enjoy reading it but it was an interesting experience I'm not willing to repeat. The Catcher in the Rye follows one day in sixteen year old Holden's life from his POV, but his never-ending angst and destructive behaviour made it feel like a thousand years to me. Holden Caulfield is having one helluva time, or he would be if he wasn’t pretending half the time to be like everyone else and the other half confused, mad and ‘sweating like a bastard’ because of all the ‘phonies’ and expectations of all those around him. It was occasionally funny and insightful but the language, repetitive words and Holden’s angsty depressing mind was specially painful to get through. It took me five months of reading off and on to get through this short 214 pages and I’m so glad it is over at last. In the words of Holden, this nearly ‘killed me’.There are many ways of looking at this story and what Holden represents and the subtext of the story such as social commentary etc. But to me, Holden Caulfield is frustrating, selfish, self-destructive and very confused. He doesn’t know what he wants and doesn’t want to do anything to help himself or let anyone help him. This is Holden In a nutshell…Holden is a hypocrite because he calls other people who he thinks are fake or insincere a phony and then he goes and does the same thing. He lies a lot, fakes feelings or emotions he doesn't have and makes promises he has no intention of keeping. He refuses to take responsibility for his actions and grow up. He can see everyone else's faults except his own. This means …Holden Caulfield is a phony!",

His is not a regular coming of age tale in which the character's view of the world changes from child to adult. Holden instead finds himself trapped between these two perspectives, and their friction has as a result a feeling of being lost and misunderstood which is reflected by his thoughts throughout this short novel.Salinger made Holden's demeanour ridiculously enjoyable and interesting for me. I loved his one liners and the in absentia figure of Jane through the book - the fact that we never get to see her contemporary self is a nice, unexpected touch. This book won't work for you if you're not into character development as it is ultimately  of a description of a boy's personality than it is a story per se. That being said, if this is your thing please give it a chance. Wish there were  books like this nowadays rather than having to fall into the same silly plot twists every time.",

I don't mean that it's because he'd have some snotty remark about anything I did. He really would. For one thing, I'm not anything special to look at. Really, anyone who can't be trusted to not mention if someone is pretty or not first thing wouldn't be someone I'd want narrating my head. I used to think how I couldn't wait to be too old for people to stop sizing me up that way. But then I'll hear the jerks at work get all personally affronted an elderly lady doesn't make their dicks hard and I know it's no good (Holden takes the time to note how the old wife of his former school teacher looks so old when he shows up at their house in the middle of the night!). Anyone with a healthy (well....) dose of self awareness already gets depressed on a hair trigger. It can be just remembering against your will (or even worse if you know you do it on purpose) the no running scenarios can change it. Say some guy at work tells another guy you have a huge crush on him (you emphatically don't) and you're still treated to gentle letdowns. Yeah, I'm probably  the awkward person who exudes some horrible thing Holden would wish he had not seen. The awful thing is he set up a shanty town in my head years ago. I read The Catcher in the Rye when I was a teenager. I loved it but he got on my nerves back then too. The constant overuse of words and phrases. I know I hated him for feeling sorry for girls because they were so stupid (and can't make a boy stop during sexy times because they get too excited. Please! He should hang out with a Bukowski character. They can award the pretty girl-objects to the moving set pieces men they hate so they don't have to see anything). This is my friendship question on goodreads. I can't remember exactly how I phrased it now, but I know it meant what voice do you wish you had with you all the time. If you could get this strength from an outside of you. I see it as being this awesome thing like you were at something that's making you so tired and there's this living consciousness, rescuing you from the starving madness. Holden reminds me of the kind of person who says they like all dogs better than all people because they just like to see everybody as so shallow they aren't even in the water. The dog's eyes are windows to their pure spirits blah blah blah. I love dogs but I've seen them rape each other, gang up on runts, and oh the animality. It's probably some off the hook thing since dog's couldn't answer to their same spirit. The constant worry that someone is going to do something phoney so he can't rest is the line. He just didn't want to risk being one of them. They only have to not be there for Holden to allow their own presence. I don't want to worry about that going on in the backs of other minds orbiting around. So I don't know about bores. Maybe you shouldn't feel too sorry if you see some swell girl getting married to them. They don't hurt anybody, most of them, and maybe they're secretly all terrific whistlers or something. Who the hell knows? Not me.I also kinda hated Holden because he's got a lot of get out of jail free cards in life. His parents are stinking rich, and he's already been expelled from a lot of schools. Some other kid would have ended their childhood the first time. I can't help thinking about an ugly girl who was poor. She doesn't know any of the right things to say. She says all of the worst things and when she goes to the asylum she's not getting out on promises to apply herself. Not that Holden is going to promise any such thing (unless it's one of the dozens of times in 'Catcher' when he nodded his head to the broken record about what he needs to do to stand on his own feet). Holden takes it for granted life is waiting with a dirty rich job and accessory wife. But would he hate the contract most everybody has to march to if it cost him anything? Not just trying to get a girl to fuck you, Holden, but after you go along with the bullies in school? What about going to work every day? Like when he sneaks a visit to his kid sister, Phoebe. Holden does his worthless bragging about what a great clothes shopper his mom is and how the kid looks good arranged. What I thought was how awful it would be if you had to go about being dressed by someone else. Yet Holden half misses when he was a kid himself. Going to the natural history museum on frequent school outings. Each day they are the same and you are changed in some perceptible way if you are in the mood to think about it like that. I would have been. I have always made myself note how things were before something I was looking forward to happening, thinking \"You're going to wish it was now when it's over so you could be looking forward to it again\". Then after I'd make myself think about how I thought about I'd wish it was then. There's something how Holden describes it though, like he doesn't want to touch it again. He's putting everything in specimen jars. There's this doing it on purpose feeling about Holden that makes me nervous. When he's talking about people and something about them that's wrong. When they do something he likes it is the same. He's making time stop and go backwards. If you could look forward to something he's making himself do the opposite of that. I wouldn't study either (\"Enough with Jennifer Lopez is on tv! I can't go to class!\"). It's still pisses me off that it doesn't hurt Holden at all because then he's not a real person. He's just a ghost not going through anyone. I don't care when he likes anyone any  than I did when he doesn't. It doesn't mean anything to be good at holding hands. I didn't feel like he felt sick to his stomach being like that. I always did. I got into debt flunking school and I should have known myself better than to think I'd really push my way through this time. When you screw your eyes shut to when you're fucking everything up to yourself on purpose feels like something. There's just a little dread that his parents are going to be disappointed in him. His little sister-- Oh yeah, I had wanted to say that when Phoebe calls out his no answer on ONE thing he likes? That it doesn't count when he names his dead brother Allie? I had this bad feeling about Holden like he's too close to no one else being any good so I was glad there was somewhere to breathe that wasn't that. Even if he doesn't. So he won't be really happy in the rain with the flicker for one thing he wanted to do. I feel like when Holden throws it all away for something stupid (it's not all people getting drunk so they can be easily impressed in some stupid bar) it doesn't count. He says he misses those guys he worked up to hate (I stopped my reread for months because he wouldn't shut up about Ackley's poor hygiene). I always want something to happen like when Holden hears the boy singing about the catcher in the rye. Something to be really happy about. I have always tried to miss people too. I have often thought about how Holden missed them, too. (I would think about when he said catholic people enjoyed the conversation  if you were catholic too. I remembered a lot and maybe it'll be like that again where I forget how it seems like nothing what he admires. I don't really care if anyone looks good while dancing) Why does it feel like the same coin? I'm unsettled by how empty it feels whenever Holden likes something about anyone. It feels so damned worthless, most of the time, whenever he likes someone. It doesn't feel any different than what he thinks about someone else without ever knowing them. Everyone he knows could stand behind the life of it isn't hard to do the necessary real life things. He is too close to doesn't have to, though, so the lines might as well be drawn some place else. I think of Holden like the girl who is wrecked by tears, inconsolable to the gray life. You've eaten it  than you ever wanted to, too. You try to give her something good, whatever you have. She just cries harder. Because she wanted someone good to say those things. It would have meant something from someone else. ",

Simply put, this is one of the best selling novels of all time and has remained a hot commodity (averaging about 250,000 copies a year). With so many people reading this book, with so much academic emphasis placed upon it, and with persistent conversation about the book over time, it has simply become difficult to establish order in the chaos.

Well let's explore a couple of the different ways someone might \"get something\" out of this novel:It seems the predominant view of this book is that it is essentially a novel of teen angst. That it deals with the issues of having to grow up, give up your childhood, and find our place in the big, scary, uncertain world. This view might also claim the book deals with issues of belonging, alienation, and some identity issues. From what I've seen, people who subscribe to this interpretation of the novel are also likely to claim that they identify with Holden Caulfield (the main character from whose point of view the book is written). That they get him, or perhaps  accurately, that Holden Caulfield gets the reader. Some people who do not hold this book in high regard often arrive at the same interpretation, but take the opposite position. They claim that Holden Caulfield is a whiny brat. That he needs to just get over his problems, grow up, and stop being so annoying. Now, I'm not particularly qualified to tell someone what a book is or is not about, and if someone wants claim that one of the above descriptions is an accurate portrayal of the book, then I can't exactly tell them that they're wrong. But I sort of think it. Perhaps not so much that they're wrong, but that they aren't entirely accurate. You see, I believe it's a drastic error to think that this book was written for the reader. I think this book isn't written for us, it's written for J.D. Salinger, and it just happens to be published so we can read it. What I mean by that, is that the author of this book is inseparable from the novel itself. J.D. Salinger was drafted into the army for World War 2, and fought in Europe, from Normandy to Berlin until the end of the war. He participated in D-Day, The battle of the Bulge, Bastogne, and countless other horrific engagements. He was also one of the first Americans to enter and liberate a Nazi concentration camp. He told his daughter once that \"You never really get the smell of burning flesh out of your nose entirely, no matter how long you live.\" It's no large stretch of anyone's imagination to say that J.D. Salinger was suffering, deeply, from PTSD. So let's look back on Holden Caulfield. A teenager who seems unable to move on with his life. He saw (view spoiler)[a classmate commit a violent suicide while wearing an article of Holden's clothing (hide spoiler)]. And let's not forget Holden's most important source of trauma (view spoiler)[his little brother Allie, whose death he blames himself for (hide spoiler)]. The big sort of \"reveal\" at the end is that (view spoiler)[Holden is telling the whole story to a doctor within the walls of a mental institution (hide spoiler)]. Does Holden Caulfield behave the way he does in the novel because he's some angsty teen who feels uncertain about his future, or does he behave the way he does because he's a teenager suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress? After The Catcher in the Rye was published, J.D. Salinger quickly became a recluse and withdrew from public life. I can imagine why. He writes a novel that is the manifestation of his way of trying to work through unimaginable trauma, and in return he gets middle-class teenagers saying, \"That's just like me! I know what he's going through!\" That may be true for a very small percentage of readers, but for most of us we simply don't. Now, if someone wants to like the book because it \"speaks\" to them, or because it deals with some issues that they can connect with, then that's great! I'll almost always applaud when someone finds a new book they love, and I'm not trying to dismiss other people who either like or do not like this novel.I simply think it's particularly important to keep context in mind when talking (or disagreeing) about this book. I obviously do have a higher opinion of this novel, since I rated it 5-stars, but I have a high opinion of the novel because it reveals to me some interesting ways in how the human mind works. I find I can respect Salinger for writing a book that was so personal to him, and I enjoy romping through a true war-veteran's portrayal of a boy who lost his innocence and is trying to make sense of the world and people around him. Holden's narrative is often flavorless, his descriptions minute, unfair, and childish. Yet, that's the point. Holden focuses on the unimportant things about people and life, gives them a meaning that is blown out of proportion, and snags himself on these small details. Why? Because it's a coping mechanism that prevents him from dealing with the things that truly matter. He uses the term phony throughout the book. Why is everything phony? Because reality is too painful. Bottom line? I enjoy this book. I think there's a surprising amount of meat to chew on, for it being such a quick read. Some people might say, \"Oh, there's THAT guy. He's one of those who like The Catcher in the Rye. He's one of THOSE types of people.\" But frankly, that's fine. I don't like this book because I'm trying to make some emotional statement. I just simply like it. Is it the best book ever? Of course not. But I dig it for what it is, and I think everyone should give it a fair chance. ",
        "I just finished reading Nine Stories and had no intention of reading  Salinger right away. But I was surprised at how cute and clever I found his writing after all these years.

I mean, every page had a quotable paragraph or two! No kidding. I could just quote the whole first three chapters. But what kind of book review would that be? You might as well just read the book yourself. Of course, you might have to be in the same kind of Holdenish mood that I am in – like a wise ass and goofy at the same time. I don’t think I was Holden Caulfield when I first read this book fifty years ago. But I think I might have reached that level of cynicism now. There must be a least a dozen books out there that dissect Salinger as a writer but most often as a person. I have read some of them and have several  on my shelf awaiting the proper moment. But as I wait,  books are always being added to the stack. I am not the only one needing an occasional Salinger fix. So here is the obligatory opening from  The Catcher in the Rye:If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them.Feel better now? I do!I am trying to remember why Salinger was banned back in the last century as I am reading Catcher in the Rye in 2014. Could it have been because of paragraphs like this one? I didn’t turn it off right away, though. I just kept laying there on Ely’s bed, thinking about Jane and all. It just drove me stark staring mad when I thought about her and Stradlater parked somewhere in that fat-assed Ed Banky’s car. Every time I thought about it, I felt like jumping out the window. The thing is, you don’t know Stradlater. I knew him. Most guys at Pencey just talked about having sexual intercourse with girls all the time – like Ackley, for instance – but old Stradlater really did it. I was personally acquainted with at least two girls he gave the time to. That’s the truth.  Sex and profanity? It was the polite 1950s! Maybe Salinger wouldn’t have become so famous if he hadn’t been so infamous. Maybe it was because he said some things about mothers that weren’t so kind. Right that minute, the conductor came around for old Mrs. Morrow’s ticket, and it gave me a chance to quit shooting it. I’m glad I shot it for a while, though. You take a guy like Morrow who’s always snapping their towel at people’s asses – really trying to hurt somebody with it – they don’t just stay a rat while they’re a kid. They stay a rat their whole life. But I’ll bet, after all the crap I shot, Mrs. Morrow’ll keep thinking of him now as this very shy, modest guy that wouldn’t let us nominate him for president. She might. You can’t tell. Mothers aren’t too sharp about that stuff.  I mean, Holden was really good at shooting it and could have gotten Salinger into a lot of unnecessary trouble. In fact, I guess he did. He called Morrow a “sonuvabitch” when the guy’s mother wasn’t around. Salinger didn’t invent trash talk, but Holden, well ...And, of course, young sister Phoebe challenged Holden to think of something he liked and Holden imagined the scene we all associate with this book: “Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody’s around – nobody big, I mean – except me. And I’m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff – I mean if they’re running and they don’t look where they’re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That’s all I’d do all day. I’d just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it’s crazy, but that’s the only thing I’d really like to be. I know it’s crazy.” Is recapturing the moment when you first read that paragraph years ago, worth reading the entire book again? At that very moment it seemed like it was worth it. Five stars. That one extra star is for that moment. I guess that is serious nostalgia.Now on to read one  book that dissects Salinger based on too little information. The man was a mystery. ",

I can remember going through that part of my life and I cringe looking back at certain moments when I let those emotions/feelings dictate something I said or did. It’s not that they don’t hold value but that the person is acting upon them immediately and in an over the top way. As you get older you learn to blunt the sharp edges of those feelings and let them simmer  before acting upon them. You also learn to vent better by talking them out or writing them down (to name a few), so you can see the root of the issue and understand why you are reacting the way you are.This is the story of a boy that is letting every emotion and feeling he has immediately guide every decision he makes. If school sucks you quit, if your family doesn’t understand you run away, if your friend goes on a date with the girl you like you pick a fight with him. He isn’t allowing any time to review those feelings and to understand better why he is feeling them. Everything he feels is unique to only him and everything he does is in the moment. I completely understand that this is common behavior for that age range (I was guilty of it myself) and I am not knocking Holden for it. I’m sure I will look back in twenty years at my current self and cringe for a whole new set of reasons with the midlife crisis phase of my life being right around the corner. From the reader’s perspective you are inside of Holden’s head listening to his side of it all and at first it is quite an interesting voice. It doesn’t take long for that interest to wane and for his voice to drift into nails on a chalkboard territory. It’s like whatever made the writing style unique and amazing at first didn’t last throughout the rest of the book. A few chapters in and I could have started skipping paragraphs and/or chapters and I would not have lost the plot at all. It was just him internally rationalizing his self-destructive behavior and not understanding why the results of that behavior was happening to him. You can like a book for different reasons such as writing style/voice, characters, story and how it made you feel, and I could not check any of those boxes for this book.",
        "Depressed, disoriented, displaced, and later, you learn that he is also traumatized. So goes Salinger's teenaged protagonist, Holden. When he tells you in the beginning that he doesn't want to talk about his \"lousy childhood\" and how his \"parents were occupied\" before they had him, be thankful that he told you at least that because Holden doesn't seem to like talking about what's bothering him.

So goes Salinger's teenaged protagonist, Holden. When he tells you in the beginning that he doesn't want to talk about his \"lousy childhood\" and how his \"parents were occupied\" before they had him, be thankful that he told you at least that because Holden doesn't seem to like talking about what's bothering him. He will, however, tell you about everyone else. It helps that at first glance, Holden commands your attention. This is where Salinger's mastery of character-voice is spellbinding, he seems to enjoy toying with stream of consciousness, seamlessly veering between first and second point of views, to create fiction in opposition of boarding schools, much like Orwell did in his nonfiction essay, Such, Such Were The Joys.Holden is disappointed in human behavior: You should've seen the way he did with my roommate's parents. I mean if a boy's mother was sort of fat or corny-looking or something, and if somebody's father was one of those guys that wear those suits with very big shoulders and corny black-and-white shoes, then old Haas would just shake hands with them and give them a phony smile and then he'd go talk, for maybe a half an hour, with somebody else's parents. I can't stand that stuff. It drives me crazy. It makes me so depressed.From there on, we enter Holden's depression. And you see why the protagonist is a young boy. The rant would not have worked for an adult because, as we know, the teenage mind is an enigma. Yes, teenagers can get away with such rueful raves. This teenager is the son of absent parents: a hard-working but distant lawyer-father, and a semi-reclusive mother. His older brother is a famous writer, his other brother is deceased (and you can tell that this really bothers him) and he simply adores his little sister, Phoebe. So what's the problem? Well, you don't get snippets until later in the book. But back to Holden's depression, because he makes you aware of it throughout the book. This is one instance where showing versus telling in literary fiction, is done with equal measure. Eighty pages in: Holden is too depressed to care whether he had a good view or not in his hotel room (you heard correctly, this teeanager manages to purchase booze and hotel rooms and all). Ninety eight pages in: Radio City Music Hall makes Holden so depressed, he just can't stand it. One hundred and six pages in: \"New York's terrible when somebody laughs on the street very late at night. You can hear it for miles. It makes you feel so lonesome and depressed.\"Lots of opinions, that Holden. He is a virgin who somehow has procured knowledge about women. And just because he doesn't do his schoolwork, don't think that he doesn't read. In fact, he will tell you how considers A Farewell to Arms a phony book, but he is crazy about The Great Gatsby .Almost two hundred pages in, and I thought something was going to happen. Really, I did. Phoebe intervenes and you really start to see Holden because through their dialogue, she's telling us some things. Afterwards, when his former teacher, Mr. Antolini intervenes, my hopes are really up because maybe this is turning into a lesson after all, especially since the teacher gives Holden the \"many, many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now...you'll learn from them\" speech. Then boom, my hopes are smashed when Holden thinks Mr. Antolini is being--well, you know. The trauma from seeing another kid die in such a horrific way, plus the trauma that comes from people always being \"perverty\" around him in boarding school, makes you understand why Holden is so depressed. But the idea that there is not enough of a setup to allow you to really see him clearly (in fact it's easy to miss the important details) is also depressing. Not to mention the fact that there is no silver lining at the end.Sigh. Now I'm a bit depressed. *3.5 stars*",

All I knew was this was on the classics list, I hadn’t read it, and it was one of the most banned books in history, based on language, violence, promiscuity, and the threat of encouraging moral decay. The book is about a young teenage boy named Holden who gets kicked out of many schools. It’s all about him and his rebellion at everything. It’s said that it’s an analogy for growing up. All I saw was a teenager who saw through a lot of people’s bullshit and walked away depressed because of it. He expressed himself as most teenagers of his time, granting Salinger a comment in excellence at his portrayal of a young boy’s angst. But other than that, I can’t say it moved me too much. After mulling it over for awhile, I think there were some themes dealing with a coming of age and lost innocence. I could see that in his dream, he was seeing himself leaving childhood and becoming the much dreaded adult. I also saw some of where Holden spoke much of what he didn't like in people that could probably be construed as racist. In today's politically correct world I can see how that would rub people the wrong way. I'm a big fan of telling it like it is and I think his honesty at his prejudices make him a deeper  developed character. I heard a quote once that said, \"You show me a man who's not prejudice, and I'll show you a really good liar. - Anonymous\" I completely agree. I also often agreed with young Holden in his views of how “phony” people could be, especially when he comments how when a girl he doesn’t like asks him to join her at her table in a bar, he’s forced to join her or leave…and thinks how often people just “mess stuff up for you”. He was irritated because he had to leave. Over all, I can’t say it was a page turner, but I would have to recommend it for the sheer fact that it was banned so many times and has become so controversial. I believe there are much  controversial books out there and it never ceases to amaze me which the general public tend to focus on. I also believe that the social and historical context of a book needs to be looked at when evaluating whether or not it should be a classic. I think for the time period of when this book came out, it was very controversial and prompted people to fight against the system, especially the young, which was another reason why it was probably banned. Due to the underlying themes, unique style of writing, the fact that it has a huge following, and that it is so controversial, I label it a classic as well. It takes time to appreciate some books some time, but perseverance always allows the greatness of a story to shine through.  ClassicsDefined.com",

I fall into that latter category. However you feel about it, there is little doubt that The Catcher in the Rye effectively captures the reality of being a teenager with haunting accuracy and articulates so well what it feels like to be that awkward age between childhood and adulthood. It was published at a time when young adult fiction didn't really exist, so that in itself spoke to teenagers at that time. It also had - and continues to have - mass appeal: published in the lead up to the Civil Rights Movement, Holden became an icon of teenage rebellion for disaffected youth, and throughout history (even in the wake of Trump's Presidential election) young people have turned to the novel for understanding. Part of the beauty and the popularity of this book is that Holden's teenage angst speaks to everybody. It has been called \"The Great American Novel\" but I think it should be called \"The Great Teenage Novel\", because while not all of us are American, all of us have been teenagers. The Catcher in the Rye opens with seventeen-year-old Holden Caulfield residing in an unspecified institution in Southern California in either 1949 or 1950. The story unfolds as Holden recalls the events of the previous Christmas, after he was expelled from Pencey Preparatory Academy, a boarding school in Pennsylvania, owing to his unsatisfactory academic performance. The novels moves on to follow Holden on his perambulations around New York city that December as he attempts to find those few genuine people and true human connection.The novel was originally intended by Salinger for an adult readership, but Holden’s intense personal tale of his experiences amid the 'phoneys' of society has appealed to generations of adolescents ever since. Holden's stream of consciousness first-person narrative follows his exact thought processes so makes for a very intimate reading that not only speaks directly to the heart but to every generation of teenager, affirming that frustrated adolescents are not alone.The Catcher in the Rye addresses themes of identity, belonging, loss, connection, parental ignorance and sex, but most notably it is a story about the protection of innocence, especially of children, and the struggle of growing up; of that often painful transition from the comfortable and protected chrysalis of childhood to the unfamiliar and daunting reality of adolescence. I adore this book: it was one of the first novels to really speak to me as a young teenager and it will always have a very special place in my heart.",

The story is narrated from the perspective of our main character Holden Caulfield, who is telling us the story from a psychiatric facility a few months after the events of the novel. The first thing I noticed when I started reading The Catcher in the Rye was the cynicism and bitterness of Holden's voice. At first it kind of got on my nerves because Holden is just too pessimistic about life and people around him. But then I started to understand that The Catcher in the Rye was nothing  than a chronicle of Holden Caulfield's emotional breakdown and I started to sympathize with him.Now we have this whole \"Phoniness\" situation, which is probably the most famous phrase in the novel. It is one of Holden's favorite concepts. He uses it many times through out the novel in order to describe the hypocrisy, superficiality and pretension that he encounters in the world around him. Holden explains that all the adults are by definition phonies, and the worst part is that they can't even see their phoniness. Phoniness, for Holden stands as an emblem of everything that's wrong in the world, which provides him with an excuse to withdraw into his cynical isolation.Holden's loneliness is a  concrete manifestation of his alienation issues, a big part of the novel describes his almost manic quest for companionship as he flies from one meaningless encounter to the other. As a reader we understand pretty soon in the novel that Holden uses his alienation as form of self preservation, and we also easily link his unusual behavior to the death of his younger brother Allie. Even though Holden never explicitly admit it, this event has obviously affected him a great deal.The \"Catcher in the Rye\" as a source of the title of the book deserves a close inspection. When Phoebe asks her brother what he wants to do in the future he answers her with this image from the song \"catcher in the rye\" Holden wants to protect the kids playing in the rye field from falling over the cliff by \"catching\" them, in other words Holden wants to protect kids from falling out of innocence into the adult world including the knowledge of sex. The thing is that Holden is mistaken in the lyrics of the song which are \"if a body meet a body coming in the rye\" the song asks if it's wrong for two people to have a romantic encounter out in the field, which is the exact opposite of what Holden wants the song to mean.Over all I really enjoyed The Catcher in the Rye and I will definitely be rereading it in the future, I already miss Holden and his famous red hat of individuality.

It's a beautiful reciprocal arrangement. And it isn't education. It's history. It's poetry.”Salinger’s ‘A Catcher in the Rye’ is a classic coming of age novel that is entirely made up of teenage angst, raunchy observations and a lingering feeling of loss (of childhood innocence). Holden Caulfield, currently in a sanatorium undergoing treatment for his mental condition is revisiting his 16-year-old self, who has been expelled from school after failing almost all of his exams. As he travels back to New York, where his family resides, he elaborately describes the two days succeeding his expulsion. After bidding a brief farewell to his history teacher and a fight with his roommate, Holden boards a train to Manhattan with hopes to stay in a hotel. He then experiences a whole different world through his hotel room. Men and women involved in strange acts of arousal, a man dressing like a woman, events that arouse Holden but also piques his curiosity about this bit of the world that is secretive and forbidden. The same night he tries to persuade a stripper to sleep with him but without any success. He then moves on to flirting with random women at the bar. There is also a flashback to how Holden met Jane Gallagher, a girl he once dated and still admires, giving us glimpses of a care free and love struck Holden, very different from the present one. As the story moves forward, we see Holden trying to hold on tight to the good memories while simultaneously trying to fit in. Despite the lack of an obvious plot, Holden’s blatant observation and subsequent narration conveys the story well. The story ends abruptly, but also with a hopeful note giving the impression of a conflicted teenager finally getting a hang on how it all works.The reason for the title is hiding in plain sight and as the pieces of the puzzle keep coming, it starts to make sense. It is easy to empathize with Holden but what’s easier is to see yourself in him, especially if you are a 16-year-old, carrying the burden of responsibilities and are overwhelmed with the way things are progressing. For my adult self, this story is a trip back to memory lane.‘The Catcher in the Rye’ faced a ban at multiple schools and universities in the US of A because of an abundance in cuss words. Holden is honest with his feeling and his vernacular is that of a typical teenager trying to make sense of the responsibilities put on him, those that were irrelevant a few days back. He is frustrated, holding on to the feeling of freedom one experiences as a child. He wants to bawl with joy when he sees his sister Phoebe enjoy the ride in the park because he believes he is succeeding in preserving her childlike state. Holden is taking the big, scary plunge into teenage-hood and is visibly scared. He discards traditional values and refers to adults as ‘phonies’. He is rash with his actions and faces a mental breakdown every now and then.The story is also sexually explicit in places and contains multiple references to premarital sex and prostitution, which, given the year of its publication, was a taboo and was considered obscene and out of place. There’s also alcoholism, piercing remarks on God, women and people with disabilities.Right from the beginning, it’s the humor that keeps the readers gripped and it is this same humor that makes the story monotonous after a certain time. Sarcasm and irony are recurring themes and gives an impression that Holden is using it as a shield as he fails to come to terms with his own experience in the real world. Holden challenges the hypocrisy in his typical rash and ignorant ways and is brutal with his words (so much that he disrupts his relationship with his friends).In retrospect, Holden is also deeply affected by the death of his elder brother and misses his presence. He might be in need of his brother to hold his hand and guide him through this transition, but that is purely speculative. Holden in trying to fit in, to shoulder the responsibilities put on him. He is in need of a deep and meaningful connection, but his trauma prevents him from opening up. He, however, never gets violent. It’s just his tongue, relentlessly critical of himself, hurling abuses and voicing insecurities in an anxious, worrisome way.‘The Catcher in the Rye’, despite the mixed opinions, has inspired a lot of people from every walk of life with its honest narration and a protagonist who is eerily similar to most of our teenage selves. It is a classic that must be on you TBR if you’re fond of the genre. It talks about new beginnings after a particularly dreadful episode of existential crisis and gives up hope, to keep going, despite the hardships.",

I don't see anything extraordinary in him and I kinda pity the youth in his generation. I mean if they already consider someone like Holden as someone extraordinary, the people in his generation must be way too boring. And he is supposed to be a representation of the alienated youth? I just don't buy it. He alienates almost everyone and not the other way around. Holden is just not someone I could look up to. I have friends that is way  awesome than him. If you will compare Holden to the characters of this generation's teen fictional novel, I'm afraid that he will just fade in the background. I can't see anything special about this book so I don't care if a lot of people loves this novel. I'm just not the type of person that will say that a car is blue just because everyone saying it is blue even if its really red. I wonder that if this novel is published in this generation would it still be that popular. I don't think so. I reckon that it will be a major flop.",

        "The first time I read this book was in the mid-80’s, in high school. I went to a French-speaking high school about a hundred kilometers west of Montréal. At the time, everyone was listening to U2 and Tears for Fears and The Cure and only the anglophone minority of which I was a part actually understood the words to those songs. That used to kill me. You’d have a high school dance and everyone would be kind of surf-dancing to “Boys don’t cry” and most of them had no idea what the song was about, The first time I read this book was in the mid-80’s, in high school. I went to a French-speaking high school about a hundred kilometers west of Montréal. At the time, everyone was listening to U2 and Tears for Fears and The Cure and only the anglophone minority of which I was a part actually understood the words to those songs. That used to kill me. You’d have a high school dance and everyone would be kind of surf-dancing to “Boys don’t cry” and most of them had no idea what the song was about, but it didn’t keep them from adopting that pouting stance with their front hair hanging over the left side of their downcast faces.Claudia had that look too. She had this shock of really blond hair that hung down about to her cheek. She didn’t pout, though. She ruined the goddamn look by smiling all the time. God, she had a beautiful smile. She was part of the anglophone minority too on account of her parents being German, so we’d trade cassettes and joke about song lyrics and that tv show Moonlighting. I’d seek her out in the recreation hall at lunchtime, I could recognize her from way back at the end of the hall just from the set of her shoulders, even though in the mid-80’s in private schools everyone wore these jackets with huge shoulder pads, boys included, and some even went as far as to roll up the sleeves of their jackets even when they were wearing a shirt and tie, like they were in Miami Vice or something. That fad died pretty quick, but you can be sure that the French speakers were among the last ones to maintain it. So I’d seek out Claudia, she had a really straight back and she always stood with one leg straight and the other kind of bent at the knee and slightly in front of her, and this being a private school she’d be in a skirt, which was just torture, and I’d sidle up and act real cool and bored with both hands in my pockets wrinkling my blazer at the hips like I hardly cared about anything and was just passing by to talk to her because why not.At the time I was a huge cynic, the way teenagers can be when they want to appear older, and all my jokes were cynical, and Claudia would laugh at them anyway and she’d add “oh, Renaaaay, Renaaay, Renaaaay” like that, pronouncing it like “heyyyy” and I’d drop the cynical act for a moment before returning to it later.Anyways, my English teacher recommended we read the Catcher in the Rye and told us we’d find it very funny. I don’t think anyone else in my class read it, just me, and I didn’t find it funny much, but I really identified to Holden Caulfield. I think you have to be an adult to find it funny. I mostly read it and pictured myself as Holden getting kicked out of school and wandering around New York and being simultaneously charmed and repulsed by humanity. Just the opening page was enough to grasp my attention, and though the school I went to didn’t advertise with horse-riding ads, the following paragraph about Holden’s school Pencey spoke to me directly:‘They advertise in about a thousand magazines, always showing some hotshot guy on a horse jumping over a fence. Like as if all you ever did at Pencey was play polo all the time. I never even once saw a horse anywhere near the place. And underneath the guy on the horse's picture, it always says: \"Since 1888 we have been molding boys into splendid, clear-thinking young men.\" Strictly for the birds. They don't do any damn  molding at Pencey than they do at any other school. And I didn't know anybody there that was splendid and clear-thinking and all. Maybe two guys. If that many. And they probably came to Pencey that way.’ And, of course, I pictured my best friend Claudia as the character of Jane. Only it didn’t really fit, because Jane had a lousy childhood and Claudia was a happy girl who ruined her goddamn pouty look by smiling all the time. Anyways, there is this scene in the book where Holden describes how he came close to necking with Jane, and Jane’s stepfather comes around and asks her where his cigarettes are, and Jane doesn’t answer him:‘Finally the guy went inside the house. When he did, I asked Jane what the hell was going on. She wouldn't even answer me, then. She made out like she was concentrating on her next move in the game and all. Then all of a sudden, this tear plopped down on the checkerboard. On one of the red squares--boy, I can still see it. She just rubbed it into the board with her finger. I don't know why, but it bothered hell out of me. So what I did was, I went over and made her move over on the glider so that I could sit down next to her--I practically sat down in her lap, as a matter of fact. Then she really started to cry, and the next thing I knew, I was kissing her all over--anywhere--her eyes, her nose, her forehead, her eyebrows and all, her ears--her whole face except her mouth and all. She sort of wouldn't let me get to her mouth. Anyway, it was the closest we ever got to necking. After a while, she got up and went in and put on this red and white sweater she had, that knocked me out, and we went to a goddam movie.’You can bet your boots I read that and pictured myself kissing Claudia. I must have read that single paragraph a dozen times over until it was etched in my mind. There was no way I was going to be around if and when Claudia cried, she was a happy girl, but I goddamn well read it over and over and pictured Claudia putting on that red and white sweater and us going to a movie anyway.Claudia actually made an atheist out of me. She sat at a desk just behind me and in religious studies, she’d lean forward and whisper in my ear, just to goad me, asking me if I believed in what it was we were being taught, and of course I defended the existence of God as well I could by using Voltaire’s argument about there being no clock without a clock-maker, and we’d have a whispered argument right there in class. Teenagers in religious schools entertain a kind of familiarity toward faith. As in the following passage that describes the guy after whom was named a wing of the school Holden attends:‘ It was named after this guy Ossenburger that went to Pencey. He made a pot of dough in the undertaking business after he got out of Pencey. What he did, he started these undertaking parlors all over the country that you could get members of your family buried for about five bucks apiece. You should see old Ossenburger. He probably just shoves them in a sack and dumps them in the river. Anyway, he gave Pencey a pile of dough, and they named our wing alter him.[…]He told us we should always pray to God--talk to Him and all-wherever we were. He told us we ought to think of Jesus as our buddy and all. He said he talked to Jesus all the time. Even when he was driving his car. That killed me. I just see the big phony bastard shifting into first gear and asking Jesus to send him a few  stiffs. The only good part of his speech was right in the middle of it. He was telling us all about what a swell guy he was, what a hot-shot and all, then all of a sudden this guy sitting in the row in front of me, Edgar Marsalla, laid this terrific fart.’Claudia worked at me for two weeks, we’d have these whispered arguments in class, and she actually convinced me that I was mostly praying for no good reason, and I was really impressed by the way she did it and I got even  infatuated with her than I already was.Good ol’ Claudia. She didn’t play checkers that I knew of. She liked ping-pong, and she could laugh at losing a game.",

I am still wondering and going through every moments in the book, and there is a constant thread. It is the importance of childhood. This book clearly shows the life of a teenager, and Holden (the protagonist) going through the adult world. His hat, symbolized his identity, and to keep his identity private. Whenever he wears the hat, it is when he feels uncomfortable, and unsafe. The title in the book is also really interesting. After some research, it is known that J.D. Salinger wrote this book during world war II. He imagined a rye field, and in the very end, is a cliff. He/Holden, is the one on the cliff, and saving everyone falling down into the cliff. The cliff represents the adulthood, and of course, J.D. Salinger is the \"Catcher in the rye\". He wanted to show the importance of childhood since during war it was all teens and people around Holden's age that was fighting. J.D. Salinger didn't want any  teens to loose their youth, therefor writing this amazing book. Everything in the book was meaning full, but there was one quote that really impacted me deeply. \"The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one.\" I infer that the immature man is people before adulthood. And right before this quote, Mr. Antolini says that he was slowly dying, which can mean that he is slowly entering the adult world. After that he says that mature man lives for a cause, and immature man dies for a cause. This means that immature people want to leave something meaningful for people after them, and learn from him and learn from his mistakes, while mature people just think and care about their life, and themselves. Only for themselves. This book is one of my favorite books. I recommend anyone who: misses their youth, is in their childhood, or is a teen. Which should be everyone.",

He gets depressed very easily, he doesn’t want to be like all those phonies (but he totally acts like them most of the time). He acts very contradictory. On the one hand, he thinks of himself the way he would like to be seen (as somebody who’s independent from the society and has a way of treating people differently) but on the other hand he’s like zero percent different from those people he criticizes and judges. He evaluates girls after their “beauty” (making excuses when they aren’t that pretty “cause they have this one wonderful character trait”)The writing style didn’t work for me.

When a book is this praised and also notorious(?) it's difficult to gauge my personal reflections.I sympathised a lot with Holden. Almost every page is dripping with boredom, directionlessness and alienation. Particular how uncomfortable it makes others when he wants them to listen to his feelings: even fine well knowing he might not mean what he says even a few minutes later, no one can take it. He is passive aggressively “trained” into either saying nothing or exactly what someone else wants to hear. The only times he’s allowed to speak his mind at length are when he elaborates upon what he knows is exactly what the other person wants to hear, even arguing in one case, while lying to a mother about her son on the train, that she would lack so much perspective on her own son as to believe Holden’s lies forever. It’s no wonder Holden is unable to interpret his actions with no one to talk to.Post-war New York is a place in time that likely fully embraced comfort, safety, routine, and banal pleasantry, until, in Holden’s eyes, citizens became babyish phonies incapable of real interaction. The part at the end about Holden’s little sister seems to be about the perpetual production of innocence and those who will always question trivial societal structures, etiquettes and habits. Holden spends most of his time talking to adults and those who idolize adults (actors and the upper class), and given that this novel was originally intended for an adult audience, do we see Holden as representative of the coming generation to highlight the responsibilities of the adult generation to the next one down, and the harm of all their fearful fakery? Holden opts for the possibility offered by children over the rigid formalities of adults: he hopes for change.I’ve been a proper out-of-uni adult for about 2 years now and heavily steeped in all the banal status-and-banter constructs of the brainless, so I get Holden’s fears about what will happen to him when he grows up. Why wouldn’t they come true? I don’t know.I can also see why this is popular amongst alienated teen folk but I think a lot of the insights had to have been made by an adult for an adult. (Likely an English teacher will find this in two years and write back to me as if I just wrote this, at which point I’ll probably think something else! Also I’m really happy for you but Iain Banks penned the best teen angst stuff of all time!) Holden is an unreliable narrator who cannot fully articulate what his confessions are doing, which I believe is to draw together a collective mentality of reaction to the zeitgeist. He is prone to surface observations and hyperbole. He feels often that his problems are his and his alone and that nobody gets him and everyone else is fake. Loner “killers” perhaps attach themselves to his view as truth: “Me and you, Holden, me and you, and no one else!” whereas the book’s popularity is testament to many people feeling like Holden. We can be many people feeling like the only ones, but we can’t all be the only ones. To say that his angst is just a phase is kinda stupid. It may be aggravated by teenage years but it is brought about by the environment rather than Holden himself who is not inarticulate nor unintelligent. That environment still exists today. Maybe always will…Anyways, I consider myself an open guy who’s willing to discuss anything with anyone. But I’ve also perpetuated the illusion of society’s wall of artifice: say someone I don’t know very well skips a few steps in the normal social constructs of getting to know me and stands too close and does the “Don’t you just think that everyone” etcetera, you know the type, well, I’ll sigh and bat them away because their thoughts to me will be shallow and repetitious and maybe I was having a good time and don’t wanna get into it, whereas this guy will walk away thinking that his attitude has been confirmed, that he’s him and I’m one of them. Maybe I was tired. Maybe I’d had that same conversation recently with someone else and didn’t feel like having it again so soon. Maybe I was really tired. Maybe if I had  time and I knew the guy better I’d listen. Or if I thought he’d read up about his ideas even in the slightest so he could be a bit objective. Or if I didn’t suspect (or know, most times) that he had other people in his network to rant at or others that he had ranted at word-for-word the same, and didn’t feel like wasting my time helping someone who was being helped. I can forgive myself for this every now and then: after all, I’m only human and as much as I believe in the curative properties of empathy and compassion, I know them to be very slowly-renewable resources that are best conserved. But there’s only so many times I can be like that before it becomes dangerous: someone has to listen. I don’t think anyone listened to Holden; I don’t know that anyone eventually did; and I don’t know what became of him as a result.I’m  than sure all of the above has been produced by deconstruction after deconstruction of this novel but I’m not gonna read any of that, so there :DOriginal review below, which still stands:Salinger sucks.Caulfield sucks.Rye sucks.Yeah?Life sucks.You suck.I suck.Waaaaaaaaaaaah",

Holden Caulfeild is struggling with just this problem. When the story first begins, he has just been kicked out of another school. Finding himself alone on a friday night Holden gets nervous becuase his roomate is on a date with a childhood friend of his. He can't help himself but wonder what his roomate and Jane are doing. Getting agitated by that and his dormatory roomate he decides to go to New York Manhatten for the weekend. Once on the train he meets a lady, a mother of a classmate. He despises the student, but he can't help himself but to lie to her. Once off the train he goes to a motel and watches people from his widow. Next, he calls a lady that is said to be \"easy\". He tries to meet up with her that night, but she refuses and asks if he'd like to meet tomorrow. He doesn't want to so he hangs up. Now bored he decides to go down the the motels bar to get a drink, but the waiter finds out that he's not of age and doesn't serve him anything. While sitting at the bar he meets three ladies in their thirties. He flirts with them for awhile, then they make fun of his age and leave him. Stuck with all of the tabs. Once he leaves he starts to think about Jane and about their summer together. So, he decides to leave and take a cab to a jazz club where he runs into his older brothers ex girlfriend. She invites him to sit with her and her date, but he refuses by making up the excuse of having to meet someone and leaves to walk back to his motel. Once back to the motel he gets an offer of a hooker from the elevator attendent. He agrees and awhile later a girl named Sunny apears at his door. He lets her in but he doesn't want to sleep with her, so he pays her and before she leaves she demands five  dollars. Holden says no and the elavator attendent punches him and takes five dollars from his wallet. The next morning he decides to call up a past girlfriend, Sally. They decide to meet up for a broadway showing. While waiting for the date, Holden goofs off and tries to call Jane but her mother answers so he hangs up. When he does meet up with Sally he gets annoyed becuase she keeps talking to another boy at the show. He offers to take her the ice rink, but they both suck and decide to get a table. In a deep converstion about school Holden asks Sally to run away with him, but she Refuses and he replies iwth \"pain in the ass\". Not accepting his apology, she leaves. Later that night, drunk, Holden calls Sally and just rambles about meaningless things. Later, he sneaks into his apartment and sees his sister. He has to admit that he's been kicked out of school, and she's angry. He tells her that he wants to be \"the catcher and the rye\" a person who catches children as they fall off of clifs, and pheobe tell him that he's crazy and he's confused the poem. Once leaving he calls a former english teacher. He goes to his apartment, and his teacher tries to talk to him about his future, but HOlden is sleepy and falls asleep on the couch. He awakes to the teacher stroking his head, thinking the teacher is homosexual he leaves quickly and goes and sleeps on a bench. He decides he's not going back home and sends a note to Pheobe telling her so and to meethim for lunch, she comes and wants to leave with him. But, he says no and she gets upset, and follows him around. The book ends with him watching her on the ride, and telling us that he's not going to go any further withthe story. This book was an interesting mixtures of emotions, i enjoyed it  than I thought i would in the begining. I think I might look into  books by this authur in the future.",
        "Praise the Giant Flying Spaghetti Monster, the pain is over.This book has been on my radar for years. I think the first time I heard about it was that Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts movie, Conspiracy Theory, in which Gibson's character can't calm down unless he has a copy of it, and in which the government apparently uses library patron histories to identify serial killers based on who borrows The Catcher in the Rye. Or something?? I haven't seen that movie in years, so I may be wrong.Anyway, I puPraise the Giant Flying Spaghetti Monster, the pain is over.This book has been on my radar for years.

Or something?? I haven't seen that movie in years, so I may be wrong.Anyway, I put off reading this book for YEARS because a tiny part of my brain was convinced that if I borrowed it from my local library, I'd be flagged as a serial killer. But basically, all I knew about the book was that the main character is called Holden Caulfield, and it's J.D. Salinger's only novel.And I kind of wish I'd left it that way. I was on the struggle bus with this book essentially from the get go. The opening few chapters - the stuff before Holden leaves school - reminded me a lot of Dead Poets Society, and  specifically Charlie. Seeing as Dead Poets Society is one of my favourite movies, I was moderately interested in the story.But then Holden left school, and things went rapidly downhill. We're trapped in Holden's head for endless pages with few other characters to break things up. And this was hard for me, because I didn't like Holden AT ALL. He's full of rich white boy problems, where everything is someone else's fault. Holden always thinks he's in the right, despite however much evidence is stacked up against him. Essentially, I couldn't stand him or the narrative style.I REALLY didn't like the writing. Admittedly, it's a product of the time. It's set in the late 1940s and is told by a teenage boy, so the amount of misogyny that comes through in the story is almost to be expected. But the amount of repetition in the writing drove me up the wall. Holden will make an observation about another character, then insert an anecdote about that character doing the thing he observed them doing, then repeat his observation. Like, \"The girl could dance. [Insert long winded anecdote about said girl dancing here] I tell you, the girl could dance.\"YES. WE KNOW. YOU LITERALLY JUST TOLD US.By the end of the book, I just flat out didn't care, and when it featured a total non-ending on top of all the repetition and angst and misogyny that I'd already had to wade through, I was tempted to throw the book across the room.I feel like this is a book that's  enjoyable if a) you study it in school and can unpackage all the things that Salinger is trying to say, or b) you're an angsty teenager when you read it. So maybe if I'd read this as a teenager, I'd see the appeal. But as an adult? NOPE.",

WHAT I LIKED:- okay, holden wasn't actually that bad ?? sure he wasn't the most likable or sensible person in the world but he did have a BIG personality, plus you can't blame him (view spoiler)[it's later revealed near the end that he was sexually abused growing up and you can tell by how much he hates \"perverts\" and that weird ass creepy teacher. ew. (hide spoiler)]- the whole book felt like a diary. and what i mean by that is that it feels like i randomly found a diary on a park bench or something and opened it and boom ! here it was. holden's thoughts are very personal and since its told in 1pov, i felt really close to him ??- new york !!! i just love new york man. sorry.- military/boarding school setting ? yes. even though it only lasted like 8 chapters it was still a nice setting for the beginning. - and also just the last 10 chapters are written well imo. idk- holden is a realistic character imo. his personality may be blunt and a lil immature but he would def stand out in a writing game of \"guess what character\". yall know what i meanTHINGS I DID NOT LIKE:- objectifying women ? holden just acted like a very immature 12 year old half the time he was around women and that annoyed me, but it's part of his character so i can't really judge the author on that. but he could of done WAY less objectifying and  gentlemanly thoughts thank you.- it dragged at some points. even though its a short book at only 277 pages, it felt like 400 at some points. not often, but near the middle it did drag just a lil bit. - i wish it was set in the boarding/military school the WHOLE book. i really enjoyed reading about all the 'bastards' in the school and i wanted to know how the jane storyline ended. wtf.i really do reccommend this book if you aren't too triggered by some gross thoughts about women and immature holden caulfield. but this honestly is a really good book !!! give it a chance :)“I'm the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life. It's awful. If I'm on my way to the store to buy a magazine, even, and somebody asks me where I'm going, I'm liable to say I'm going to the opera. It's terrible.”",

Maybe because I read it when I was away from my family – the plot had some perspective I think. I didn’t want to be Holden, but certainly thoughts drifted in the manner he thought. J.D. Salinger knew what he was doing I think while writing this novel. What he didn’t know was the reaction or strings of actions would be created by this book.Mark David Chapman shot John Lennon and had The Catcher in the Rye in his hand. John Hinckley Jr. attempted an assassination on Ronald Reagan in 1981 and one of the books owned by him was the one written by Salinger. There are several movie and television references to the novel as well. What is it about this book that evokes such reactions? Why? To my sixteen-year old mind, unwell and in bed, it was just another novel lent to me by my uncle and I had to read it. I read it. I loved it and that was it.The Catcher in the Rye is not just another novel then. It is the voice of several generations of teenagers in the sense of the world. It is the world of angst and no sense of direction. Or maybe it is the voice of intellectualizing everything or trivializing it all. Holden Caulfield is  than an icon. He is someone who is trying to make sense of his life and life around him. It might appear to be as simple as this, when it is not or may be it is. He encounters people – different people as he takes off from his fancy school Pencey Prep and takes on his journey in New York City. This is where it all begins or almost.The book was banned in most schools in the US of A. It is because of its vulgar language, which honestly I did not have a problem with then or now. To me the writing is just surreal, even after rereading it after fourteen years. It just manages to evoke the same sentiments in me and that is why I call it timeless. It talks about adolescence and its struggle like no other book. The Catcher in the Rye in that sense of the word is truly a classic and will be for years to come. I am glad I reread it. Thanks to my The Novel Cure Reading Challenge. It is guaranteed to cure angst of adolescence.",

Holden is clearly suffering from anxiety and terrible depression, and at the age of sixteen, has been thrown out of three schools. Despite this, he is funny, caring, intelligent and insightful, and as far as he is concerned the only people who are not \"phoney\" are children. Holden likes kids, and he's good with them, he is especially close to his ten year old sister Phoebe. Throughout his story Holden mentions many times how depressed he is and a few times he states that he wishes he was dead. He has suffered great loss and trauma; the death of his beloved brother Allie. Holden also witnessed the suicide of a classmate and had reason to believe that his favorite teacher tried to molest him. As I read about Holden on his journey around New York city, I sensed that he was becoming  anxious, so anxious that he experienced two panic attacks, during one he passed out. A big part of Holden's problem is his fear of growing up, and a longing for his childhood. He hates change, and desperately wants things to stay the same, this is why he loved the museum and the carousel. Things in the museum had stayed the same for decades, and Holden went there as a child, his life was happier when he was a kid, when Allie was alive. At the end of Holden's story he is watching Pheobe ride the carrousel. \"It played the same song about fifty years ago when I was a little kid. That's one nice thing about carrousels, they always play the same songs.\" While watching Phoebe on the carrousel ride, Holden tells us how happy he feels. Holden has revealed this part of his troubled life in the confines of a psychiatric hospital, and at the end of the book I had a hopeful feeling that things would get better for him.",

I would have loved to have read this book while I was a teenager. That being said, even though I am far removed from my teenager years I had no problem identifying with the main character. This novel is a wonderful look into a character. Holden doesn't have a sense of direction even though he is smart. He feels like he doesn't belong with anyone and I imagine all of us at one time has felt like this. He tries to find fulfillment in various things but none of them work. The book also touches upon loss of loved ones and other subjects.I can see why this book was a controversy when it was released. The language (it is outdated) can be a little vulgar and so is some of the material. That isn't the point of the story though. It is about Holden and how he is feeling at the moment.

First, this is a *very* different book to a woman in her forties than it was to a teenager. Oddly, in some ways I felt I could relate to it  now. This passage, for instance:\"I took her dress over to the closet and hung it up for her. It was funny. It made me feel sort of sad when I hung it up. I thought of her going in a store and buying it, and nobody in the store knowing she was a prostitute and all. The salesman probably just thought she was a regular girl when she bought it. It made me feel sad as hell -- I don't know why exactly.\"That's the sort of weird moment I have all the time. Not that I do a lot of hanging out with prostitutes, mind you. Those days are long over. But the point is, I tend to make odd connections and think strange little thoughts like that.However, one thing I *wasn't* in a position to evaluate as a young and very dense reader was how whiny Holden can come across as. I love the scene where his younger sister Phoebe calls him out on this: \"You don't like *any*thing that's happening.\"It made me even  depressed when she said that.\"Yes I do. Yes I do. *Sure* I do. Don't say that. Why the hell do you say that?\"\"Because you don't. You don't like any schools. You don't like a million things. You *don't.*\"By this point in the book, it feels pretty true. Holden's observations can be funny and canny and even just beautiful, but past a certain point, it's hard not to want to say, \"Yes, okay, you're special and unique and a darned adorable snowflake. Now: enough with the rich-kid angst, already!\" Which is not the kind of thing I would have thought as a teenager, because I was too busy being full of angst. Okay, and trying to survive being a *real* runaway, which is rather different from fantasizing. Especially if you're female and broke rather than male and privileged. But I digress.The other reason this was such a different read several decades since the last time was that the last time I read \"Catcher,\" I hadn't just seen the trailer for a documentary about Salinger. I certainly wasn't aware that several men who adored \"Catcher\" had committed assassinations, or attempted assassinations. But that was almost all I could think about when I read it this time.And let me tell you -- reading \"Catcher\" while keeping a close eye out for the kind of weirdness a certain kind of crazy might latch onto is a very disturbing experience. Please note that even if I weren't attempting to write for a living myself, I would have very little patience with the idea of a work of art being hauled into court (a court of opinion, at least, if not of law) as both motive and weapon. And even if a book were written and published with the express intention of prompting citizens to take lives, responsibility for resulting action falls on those who commit murder. That said? Reading \"Catcher\" with all this in mind freaked me out. Because this really is a story of madness. Holden isn't some sweet, strange little puppy who's too sensitive for this cruel world. He is exactly what he frequently, jokingly refers to himself as: a madman. He refers quite lightly to shooting people. He has frequent fantasies of bloody violence, committed against both himself and others. He cares very little for most other people, calculating only what he can get from them. He seeks out boys and men he despises simply because he's lonely or bored or needs somewhere to go. He avoids the one admirable girl he knows, making moves on physically attractive but hateable women instead. (But who does he despise most of all? \"Phonies.\") Even when something makes him laugh, how does Holden describe it? Does he ever say something is funny or amusing? No. \"That kills me.\" \"That just about killed me.\" He really is murder or suicide, or both, waiting to happen.So why don't I hate this book?Well, it's brilliant. Also, I really *do* relate to some of the gems of perspective Holden has to offer. When his roommate asks him to write a composition for him, he cautions Holden not to write it *too* well, or the teacher will catch on. \"So I mean don't stick all the commas and stuff in the right place.\"Hoo, boy -- Holden starts railing on that, and brother he was preaching to the *choir.* People really *do* denigrate writing talent by boiling it down to the comparatively trivial details. People do that with *everything.* For instance: I worked for years with kids -- as a babysitter, nanny, teacher's assistant, tutor, and the dismissively named position of \"program aide\" in a home for severely disabled children, where I did everything from occupational therapy to stomach-tube feedings. I worked my arse off, is what I'm saying. And then one day my older sister, who was an actress at the time, talked about some after-school work she was doing with a fourth-grade class, and how she was having a hard time communicating with the children. \"I just don't have that magic *thing* you have with kids,\" she said.Great. Here *I* thought it was a combination of backbreaking labor, constant application, studying, figuring out what worked and throwing out what didn't, and praying for patience when I was fresh out. Turns out, I shouldn't have tried so hard! I could have just fallen back on my magic thing!Anyway. Reading this book again after so many years was a strange, often dark but ultimately beautiful journey. My friends who admire Salinger tell me this is *not* his best work, so I have \"Franny and Zooey\" lined up next. ",

Sure, I understood that it was primarily about a 16-year-old frustrated by the loss of innocence, but I now see so much  that I never paid attention to previously -- his depression/suicidal ideation, trauma surrounding his brother's death, a complicated relationship with sex, and hints dropped throughout the book about sexual abuse and pedophilia towards Holden (and even one instance regarding a peer at one of his previous schools that completely went over my head the first time I read this). This book is rife with the opportunity for analysis - I see that now, whereas previously I couldn't get past how much I detested Holden as a character. ",

        "This is the book we all had to read back in high school, along with The Great Gatsby, because our English teachers felt a responsibility to impart to us an appreciation for great literature, even though all we cared about was making out and/or eating Gorditos in our friends' Plymouth Dusters while having deep discussions about the nature of humanity.Like The Great Gatsby, this is a book that flies right over the heads of teenagers, a book that can't really be fully understood by them because theThis is the book we all had to read back in high school, along with The Great Gatsby, because our English teachers felt a responsibility to impart to us an appreciation for great literature, even though all we cared about was making out and/or eating Gorditos in our friends' Plymouth Dusters while having deep discussions about the nature of humanity.Like The Great Gatsby, this is a book that flies right over the heads of teenagers, a book that can't really be fully understood by them because they lack the appropriate frame of reference. That's no fault of theirs -- the appropriate frame of reference for both novels (and so many others taught in so many high schools) is age. Most people don't \"get\" what's so great about Gatsby until they're in their 30s, and preferably, as in my case, have at least one divorce behind them to help put it all in perspective.Since I was unimpressed with Gatsby as a teen but came to adore it beyond all measure after my divorce proceedings were finally finalized, I figured I ought to give The Catcher in the Rye an adult shot, too.The result was a resounding \"MEH.\" It certainly wasn't bad, but it didn't grab me by the face and scream I AM RELEVANT TO YOUR EXPERIENCE in the same way Gatsby did. Perhaps that's because I found Holden Caulfield to be such an insufferable little shit. He starts out unpleasant and finishes unpleasant, and I never found myself really caring whether he made his breakthrough discoveries about life or himself or the nature of humanity while eating Gorditos in his friend's Plymouth Duster. He was just miserable to spend time with, and I realized with a sense of seasickness that I was on an accelerating time-warp, speeding toward my grave; that I had crossed some threshold somewhere back about five years ago, where, during a very special and very transient point in my existence, I could have really understood Holden and identified with him; where his wryness and darkness could have spoken to me. But now I was in my 30s, I had the debt of a divorce to pay off, a car payment, and an affair with a tattooed Coastie who lived on a boat in a seedy Seattle marina and who was two years younger than me -- and that latter fact thrilled me  than it would have thrilled a Holden Caulfield, and all I could really glean from his experience was an icky sense of entitlement and a vague sensation that I wanted him to get the hell off my lawn.I missed my Catcher in the Rye window, so I couldn't feel any  strongly about this book than three stars. Alas. I'm sure it's excellent if you read it at just the right point in your life.I recommend that you read it between the ages of 21 and 26. I also recommend that you have an affair with a tattooed Coastie who's two years younger than you and lives on a boat. Best to have said affair while reading The Great Gatsby. It's really a lot better than you remember from high school.P.s. The Coastie and I are still together and are very happy with our lives, and are living in a house, not on a boat in a seedy Seattle marina. Holden Caulfield would not approve, but I do.",
        "After all the different reviews and comments that I have read about this book, I am so glad I read it myself. It was ironic, I just started reading David Copperfield a few months before and the first sentence of The Catcher in the Rye, Holden Caufield states, “If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you’ll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind ofAfter all the different reviews and comments that I have read about this book, I am so glad I read it myself. It was ironic, I just started reading David Copperfield a few months before and the first sentence of The Catcher in the Rye, Holden Caufield states, “If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you’ll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don’t feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth”. Wow, did I laugh out loud when I read that. This book was meant for me to read now. I thought I had read it back in high school, and put it down in goodreads as \"read\" and only gave it three stars because I couldn't remember if I liked it or not. Well, of course I didn't remember because I had never read it. This rating has changed.This was a journey through four days in Holden’s life that was very interesting. Life in New York, hum, nice place to visit, but don’t want to live there. The different comments I read earlier about The Catcher in the Rye was “Holden was a complaining spoiled kid”, “The dialogue was too repetitive”. I empathized with Holden, really felt for him. Many of his statements were true. His main theme of phoniness was right on. It was too repetitive? That’s what this story is all about –Holden’s thought process. His relationship with his sister, Phoebe, was the warmest and happiest parts of the book. His interaction with the nuns at the coffee shop counter was priceless, and the little boy walking along the curb singing was a significant scene. You could see the small windows of happiness within Holden in pieces like these. And it’s funny that in reality, these small windows of happiness are out there throughout all of our daily lives, but we overlook them many times. In fact, the way he described his feelings about the museum was so accurate to the feelings I have had of past experiences. His appreciation of the simple things in life was evident in many instances.Holden’s sympathy for the kids at school who weren’t as popular, who had the pimply faces; Holden seemed to be  compassionate towards them. In fact, he had compassion towards many of the unfortunate, and brought it out in descriptions of clothing and food. But, I interpreted an envy of those people in Holden because their lives seemed  simple, not striving for the big bucks, not keeping up with the Joneses, just living life. Not phony.Now I have to say, I did not “get” The Catcher in the Rye title at first and did not understand the carousel horse on the front page, but as I read on it became very clear and the tears came streaming down my face. I love this book for so many intimate reasons that I can’t get out here on \"paper\". I can really relate to Holden. Excellent read. Five star.",

I was so glad that Holden listened to what Phoebe said. Also when Holden gave some money to the nuns and every time he said he was lonesome.

I was so glad that Holden listened to what Phoebe said. Also when Holden gave some money to the nuns and every time he said he was lonesome. Man… How could a sixteen year old boy be so lonely like him? I mean, I came to this state of mind when I was at least in my twenties. He’s such a real thinker. That’s why this book got me mull over a lot. Like this one Holden said:“How would you know you weren’t being a phony? The trouble is, you wouldn’t.”I guess those two sentences is what had been in Holden’s mind for years. He thought everybody, almost everybody, he’d ever encountered is a phony. What they did was not quite sincere. And I guess that’s why Holden never got along with school. It’s a burden for him. He didn't care about being a smart person, he didn't need to be a man with a respected job just like his father cause it made him one of those phonies. Did it for money or to gain respect. What he thought was not all true. No one knows what’s inside human’s heart. And yes, he sounded unreliable and self-centered, but I guess he just wanted to do what he desired. Not for the money or any insincere and deceitful things. He said he just wanted to live in the west and ride a horse. Be near with nature. Or to be the Cathcer in the Rye.The first time I read the title, I was frowning. It’s weird. What does it mean? In the following pages, it said it was actually the song/poem by Robert Burns: “If a body meet a body comin’ through the rye!” And just then Holden said he wanted to be a catcher in the rye.“Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody’s around ― nobody big, I mean ― except me. And I’m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff ― I mean if they’re running and they don’t look where they’re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That’s all I’d do all day. I’d just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it’s crazy, but that’s the only thing I’d really like to be. I know it’s crazy.\"Once again let me say how I love this book so much and surely I love Salinger’s writing style. The way he described Holden’s mind and his experiences and the words Salinger's used which was really killing me. It is really a deep book for me but still it’s entertaining. I didn’t mind about the cussing at all, btw. I could just read through the pages casually like nothing’s bad ever happened.",
        "I don't often re-read books - a practice I'm hoping to change some as I expand my library - but Salinger's masterpiece was sitting on my shelf so I decided to give it a second look. Why?

Why? Well, it has been at least a decade since my first reading, and it was a boring, rainy day outside, and it came up in conversation once or twice during my time at Columbia, so I said hey, just knock this one out in an afternoon and see what you think. Well, one week later, here I am writing a review.Let's talk about the voice first; that's where this book begins (and ends?) There's a reason young, brash first-person male narrators are always compared to Holden Caulfield - he's a memorable character. And of course, he's exceedingly unreliable throughout, he comes out and tells you how easy it is to lie to people, so that keeps the reader pleasantly off-balance. We also know from the first page that he's writing to us from some sort of treatment/rehab center, so clearly we have to read everything with a healthy dose of skepticism. I like that level of complexity. It never felt gimmicky to me. And the way that Salinger let the story unfold, with Holden sometimes giving us too much of some things (like calling up old Jane Alexander) and not enough of others (mostly in the resolution), I thought that was great. The story itself isn't all that interesting: Prep-school dropout goes on a bender in New York City, accompanied by cigarettes alcohol and his somewhat indifferent libido. Nothing terribly surprising happens, at least from my modern perspective. Maybe a 16-year old hiring a prostitute used to be a big deal, but that scene played out about as I expected (and maybe not just b/c I'd read it before?). Or maybe a venerated high school teacher coming onto his favorite student used to be a big deal, but that scene seemed pretty subdued now too. Nothing felt terribly outdated, don't get me wrong, but the story wasn't what kept me invested in the book.The book is a perfect length, and it covers the right amount of ground for this character. Any  time spent with Holden and his constant momentum swings on life, from \"everything is gorgeous\" to \"everything is lousy,\" would have been too much to stomach. But I think this book still holds up as a classic tale of the exhuberance and pain that comes with growing into adulthood. ",

That is what they are for and for the post part, that is what they are all prepared to do. It dies not mean be one and make their life hell. That being said, we have a turd of kid, and he is not even a polished one at that, named Holden Caulfield. He is this rebellious little shit that is whiny and insufferable. He hates everybody around him, he can't commit to anything, everything gets on his nerves (even people who don't have shitload of money to buy expensive suitcase like his parents do - imagine that, a world full of poorer people than him). He uses the word \"for Chrissake\" and \"goddamn\" 50 times on every fucking page. He makes plans to do nice thing, normal things, and backs out at the last minute, like a dick. Not much else happens besides him calling people and being a dick. There were some parts where I though he might redeem himself and realize how much of dumbass he was, but no. This book is one of the reasons I hated reading in high school. I Sparknoted the hell out of books like these because I could not relate to them in any way. (BTW, if anybody does not know what Sparknotes is, it was a best friend of those who don't like to read because the website analyzed every book that is popular so you don't have to read it). Now, anybody who tells me this is a classic or that I \"don't understand it\" can kiss the whitest, fattest part of my ass. It is bullshit. It is not smart and it is not accurate.

Holden is such a relatable, comforting, yet truly thought provoking character. The writing style of this book, as if the words came from Holden's head and onto the paper, was very refreshing and absolutely hilarious. However, I think the particular way in which he talks brings a light-hearted feel to the dark thoughts he has through out the book. I appreciate the fact that playful language was exactly what kept me from crying myself blind and staring at a blank wall deep into the early hours of the morning, questioning all the change in my life and the big scary issues that I will have to face as an inventible part of growing up. Being a teen, I can relate to the feelings that Holden feels (minus all the shenanigans he gets up to): the loneliness, the waves of depression, the impulsive behaviour, and the bits of his past he randomly remembers which depress him even . There were three main themes, though, that I thought we very relatable; the isolation he feels, his desire/need to preserve his childhood and his fear of change. Even when Holden is talking to someone or hanging out with them, he still seems very alone and disconnected. The way he classifies people as \"phony\" and how he thinks of himself as the opposite is the wall that separates his desire for an \"intellectual\" conversation and the other person's desire, according to Holden, to show off. Throughout the whole book, Holden acts very childish and boyish, we also see his immaturity in the way he talks. The fact that he can't settle down at school and get serious about his studies, or how he can't seem to get intimate with a girl or deal with any physical contact at all, shows me, as a reader, how much Holden is holding on to his childhood, his innocents and his fear of responsibility and commitment, but he simply chalks it up to, \"not being in the mood\"Speaking of which, he is very indecisive, impulsive, spontaneous, and can't stick to the original plans he makes for himself. This is why it can be assumed that the plans he makes for his future: buying a cabin somewhere in the woods, pretending to be deaf-blind and never have another conversation again, marrying a deaf-blind girl, and not visiting home for a while, were never really going to happen and were all very unrealistic. Holden also has a connection to a girl he used to know when he was kid, Jane Gallagher. Throughout the book, Holden thinks about her and the time they spent together. He also thinks about calling her many times throughout his \"journey\" (if you'd even call it that) but always changes his mind. The book ends without us not really knowing what happens wth Jane. However, I think Jane symbolises Holden's childhood and a good, true, pure relationship. The reason why Holden never calls her up, is because he's scared she'll be a \"phony\" or she'll have changed into a person that Holden doesn't like, ruining the memories he has with her Holden's siblings also play a huge role in this book and dominate his thoughts, a lot of the time. D.B., his big brother, traded his raw talent for whatever was trending in Hollywood, just to please big producers and earn money. Holden believes that D.B. isn't true to himself and his talents and his original writing style, classifying him as, you guessed it, a \"phony\"His little brother, Allie, however, is the opposite. Allie died of leukemia when Holden was still a kid. Holden think so highly of Allie because all his memories with him are when they were kids. This is significant because Allie will never grow up to be a \"phony\", there is no risk, no possibility of Holden changing the way he sees Allie because he has passed away. His little sister, Phoebe is an important character because she is very smart and has a pure, kind nature. She is able to pick up on things that most kids don't notice and Holden is able to appreciate the same things as her and is able to hold a good conversation with her, which is something Holden struggles with throughout the book. Phoebe is also Holden's only sibling that doesn't abandon him. D.B. went off to Hollywood, Allie passed away, but Phoebe was the only person that could bring him joy. She kept him grounded and kept him from continuing to run away from his problems. Holden has such a fear of change and this is shown many times. For example, he continuously asks and thinks about the ducks in the Central Park lake and where they go for the winter. Holden seems very disturbed by the thought of having to change and alter your life in able to survive. Holden's fear of change is also shown with Holden's obsession with the museum. All the exhibits are encased in glass and, obviously, never change. He finds comfort in the fact that everything is exactly as it was the last time he visited it, many years ago. \"The best thing, though, in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was. Nobody’d move. . . . Nobody’d be different. The only thing that would be different would be you.\"Holden's fear of change connects back to the theme of immaturity and his fear of growing up. He is afraid of the commitment and responsibility that comes with being a grown up. It could be argued that in order to be successful, you have to give in to what the general public will buy, you have to produce what will sell. This is seen in Holden's older brother, D.B. He goes off to Hollywood to pursue his writing career, but Holden feels D.B. is abandoning his original style or writing and is succumbing to the needs of his readers. This is the exact thing that Holden wants to avoid. He wants to achieve success by doing things he wants to do, things he likes doing and doing them on his own terms. This is the reason why Holden passes English and fails every other class. He clearly enjoys English, thus getting good grades and applying himself.  \"I’m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff—I mean if they’re running and they don’t look where they’re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That’s all I’d do all day. I’d just be the catcher in the rye and all.\" This quote is from Holden's conversation with his sister Phoebe. This is his response when she asked him what he wants to do with his life, and it's also the quote that connects the title to the rest of the story. This quote makes he think that Holden sees himself as a protector of innocents. He is trying to keep all these kids safe from falling off the cliff. In other words, he is trying to preserve their innocents for as long as he can, maintaining his oversimplified view of the world. To him, children are easier to talk to because they are childish and naive, much like he is himself, whereas adults are hypocritical and superficial. He is actually able to get  out of a conversation with children, than he is with an adult. His catcher in the rye fantasy reflects his own innocence, his belief in pure, uncorrupted youth, and his desire to protect that spirit; on the other hand, it represents his extreme disconnection from reality and his ignorant, naive view of the world. All in all, as I'm sure you can tell by this long review, I REALLY enjoyed this book.",

I'm glad that I read it when I was young, though; this is a book for the young. Not everybody is attracted to Holden once they are old enough to see how flawed his logic can sometimes be. He's hypocritical, judgmental, immature and over-sensitive. But he also has a heart of gold, and the soul of a poet. He wants so badly to be sincere, and to feel that other people are sincere with him as well. That isn't how the world works, though, and he just can't reconcile himself with it yet. He's young. He's learning. That's part of what this book is about. Salinger has a magic touch that manages to fuse sadness and confusion with a dark humor that makes a long list of bitching and moaning funny enough to read. Holden has really felt these things- he is really admitting some of his most private pains- but he's a teenage boy, and so he has to confess them in an off-hand, flippant way. I think it's genius.I loved this book  than I have ever loved any book, and still love it so much that I almost feel personally insulted when people call it a pile of self-absorbed trash. It isn't. It has so much to offer; there are so many layers. If you find you can't connect with this book, you're either too old or too happy to be reading it now. Maybe you can't remember how it felt to be a confused, lonely kid with a bad mouth and good intentions. Or maybe you never were one. Either way, it has a lot  going on than plain old self indulgence. *Moreover, Holden's bourgeois background does not deny him the right to emotional discontent. I hate that argument. Perhaps instead it points to how little those comforts can absolve the pain of perceived intellectual misanthropy. He feels rejected, and he in turn rejects. Forever a classic. ",

Sure, I didn’t agree with everything he said at all but I also found myself “relating” to his endless rants. Say what you want, but he’s an interesting main character (even if not always reliable), and ffs he’s funny! His “idgaf”-attitude towards everything just adds to it, in my opinion. I think you definitely start warming up to him the  you read and you realize the type of person he is and you start caring for what he goes through. In the midst of all, he’s lonely and he’s unable to find any connection to anyone, no one who truly cares about him or understands him, except his sister. And, to top it all, he's revolted by society and the way things work... can you blame him? In fact, you can sort-of apply his rants to today's society too. Deep down, we're all phonies.

He is confused and he hates everything and everyone from time to time and he doesn't like studying but he loves reading and he aces his English classes, which is to say the only class he passes since he's been kicked out of every school he's gone to. He doesn't abide by rules and he certainly doesn't like to do what he's told.But what he really is, he's a sweetheart and very smart and a very simple person, if you ask me. He keeps calling everyone 'phony' Holden Caulfield is such a stange fella.

He doesn't abide by rules and he certainly doesn't like to do what he's told.But what he really is, he's a sweetheart and very smart and a very simple person, if you ask me. He keeps calling everyone 'phony' and yes they are. We sometimes all are. We keep doing things that doesn't have a meaning or a cause but they give pleasure to us because we, most surely, are vain and we like being flattered and we like people congratulating us when all we should really want is to be happy and help people.What Holden wants is to help people. He says he just pictures little kids playing in a big field of rye and he is the only big and he is standing on the edge of some cliff and what he has to do is to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff. He just wants to be the catcher in the rye. It's the only thing he'd really like to do.What I concluded from the ending is that Holden eventually gets cancer, like his big brother Allie, who died of leukemia. What I realized reading this book is that we shouldn't always think of the future, of our future, but that we should probably seize the day and live in the present, not in the future and certainly not in the past.",
        " Yes, I know, this is the book that changed everyone's lives when they read it and how dare I, blah blah. Believe me, I heard it all.The thing is, Holden's personality is what holds the whole book together. Now, I know many (many! believe me!) people who identify with Holden, and admire his struggle and need to rebel against a hypocritical society. And then there are people (like me) who can't fucking stand Holden. So the book falls apart for those people.I read this book while I was in hosp Yes, I know, this is the book that changed everyone's lives when they read it and how dare I, blah blah.

So the book falls apart for those people.I read this book while I was in hospital, and to be honest, it was a very dark time for me and I wasn't really sure I was going to make it, but you guys have no idea how trivial, how ridiculously spoiled and self-absorbed Holden Caulfield seems to someone who reads him while going through some serious shit. I was supposed to be fighting for my life but I took moments aside to wish for his life to end!So, if you like this book, great! I'm always happy when people like books, even books I dislike, and I can't fault J.D. Salinger's writing in any way, it's Holden's character I hate. So this is one of those books that always makes me go, \"Really?\" but I understand that it's one that will have a different impact on the reader, depending on what place he or she is in life.",
        "I read this as a teenager, after having been told by my mother that it had been forbidden at her high school. It was certainly not on our reading lists during the late sixties.I checked it out, took it to the beach, gleefully opened it up . . . and all I found was a tiresome whine that was punctuated by cuss words--rare to see in print in those days. The voice sounded like the worst types of guys I knew around me, the ones who told everyone how stupid they were, and how great Ayn Rand was, whileI read this as a teenager, after having been told by my mother that it had been forbidden at her high school.

The voice sounded like the worst types of guys I knew around me, the ones who told everyone how stupid they were, and how great Ayn Rand was, while spraying spit all over your shoes because they kept coming closer to rant at you while you backed away. I was so mad--there I was at the beach with a book that got even  boring and tedious, and I had nothing else so I was forced to finish it.I probably should revisit it, but . . . so many books, so little time, and I doubt I'd get much from it except a sense of that period.",

But as these phonies rise to the top it will make a very crazy world to live in. The world that Holden finds himself in. The crazy world that Salinger lived in. \"The pretend that everything is alright\", world. The phony world.",
        "“What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though.”",
        "“Among other things, you'll find that you're not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior. You're by no means alone on that score, you'll be excited and stimulated to know. Many, many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now. Happily, some of them kept records of their troubles. You'll learn from them—if you want to. Just as someday, if you have something to offer, someone will learn something from you. It's a beautiful reciprocal arrangement. And it isn't education. It's history. It's poetry.”"
